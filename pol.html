Content:
Understanding the Political Science, subject, methods, conceptions and approaches
Historical development of the Political Science
Post-World War II trends and debates
Practice session topics:
a) The role of politics in everyday life
b) Discussing the “Die Wella” case.
SIS assignment of the week: Group project on important concepts of the movie
Concept in depth
Many parts of our life may appear apolitical. This is very rarely true.
People may think that politics
has nothing to do with their
relationship. What is the
minimum age when couples
can get married? Who can
marry and who cannot?
Governments answer such
political questions.
Your emotions can be also very
political, if you commit
something that a government
defines as a crime. Your “state
of mind” maybe one of the
charges for sentencing criminal
cases.
Governments define those
political concepts
Art is what we use to express
ourselves; to expand our ideas
and personalities in a way from
which other people (and even
ourselves) can learn and take
inspiration. However, when
peaceful protests are
suppressed, art can be a tool to
convey your grievances.
Governments measure if your
art is acceptable or radical
Your everyday routine is also
political. Starting from whether
you have food & running water,
their quality, whether you are
employed, educational
opportunities, healthcare,
sense of security and rule of
law.
Governments ensure the safety
of every aspect of your life
“Man is by nature a political animal” Aristotle
Theory of recurrent cycles
Monarchies degenerate into
tyranny
Tyrannies are overthrown by
aristocracies, which degenerate
into oligarchies
Oligarchies degenerate into
exploiting population, which
overthrown by democracies
Democracies degenerate into
the intolerable instability of the
mob rule, where powerful
leaders establish themselves as
monarchs
All knowledge is conjectural, tentative and far from the final truth. Karl Popper
Political Science
“The attempt to make the chaotic diversity of our sense-experience correspond to a logically uniform of thought” (Einstein, 1970).
When politics began to be “scientific”, it meant that social scientists were becoming concerned with
objective description and generalization.
Politeia (πολιτεία) is an ancient Greek word, means “the community of citizens in a city/state.”
Aristotle used the “politeia” in his Politics, Nicomachean Ethics, Constitution of Athens, and other
works. The simplest meaning is “the arrangement of the offices in a polis” (state) (Spiro, 2021). Thus,
a new way of thinking, feeling and above all, being related to one’s fellows.
Lasswell (1950): “who gets what, when, how.”
Politics is complex, contingent and chaotic; and at the mercy of human nature from which it arises.
Thus have a great variety of conceptions, theories, methods and approaches.
Politics is the activity by which groups reach binding collective decisions through attempting to
reconcile differences among members

“You say you want a revolution
Well, you know,
We all want to change the world.”
The Beatles - Revolution.
Are they right? What do they mean by a revolution? Do we all
want to change the world? What would change the world?
Would the result be good or bad?
Political methodology provides with tools for answering all these questions (although it
leaves to normative political theory the question of what is ultimately good or bad). Methodology provides techniques for clarifying the theoretical meaning of concepts,
such as revolution and for developing definitions of revolutions. It offers descriptive
indicators for comparing the scope of revolutionary change, and sample surveys for
gauging the support for revolutions. And it offers an array of methods for making causal
inferences that provide insights into the causes and consequences of revolutions. How
big a revolution has to be to qualify as a revolution? All these tasks are important and
strongly interconnected.
(Box-Steffensmeier, Brady & Collier, 2009)
Methodology
“Criticism is the most powerful weapon in any methodology of science.” (P. B. Medawar, Advice to a Young Scientist).
•Strengths: Case studies allow for in-depth study of people, events, countries, elections, or other political questions. Case studies •Weakness: Information may not apply to other cases.
•Strengths: Large amounts of information can be gathered and quantitatively assessed; information is more general in application
than in case studies.
•Weaknesses: Wording, sampling, and other problems with surveys may compromise results; survey does not provide up-close, indepth details of a case study.
Survey research
•Strength: Experimental conditions allow researchers to carefully test hypotheses.
•Weaknesses: Participants may alter their behavior because of the conditions of the experiment; many questions cannot be tested
by experiments; in quasi-experiments, researchers lack perfect control groups.
Experiments and
Quasi-Experiments
•Strength: Researcher builds on findings of others and extends and applies large amounts of quantitatively tested data.
•Weakness: It is often difficult to compare findings observed in different research projects under different conditions and through Quantitative analysis studies asking different questions.
(Grigsby, 2012)
Dominant conceptions
Historical Conception – Building the basis of insights and resources from history that would tell us how and why we have certain values, norms and moral expectations. The history of ideas may tell us that our political
universe is a product of things whose root lies in the past. In this perspective, political theory becomes
situation-dependent in which historical situation sets a problem, which in turn taken care of through situations devised by the theory
Normative Conception (Philosophical theory or Ethical theory) – The concept is based on the belief that the world and its events can be interpreted in terms of logic, purpose and ends with the help of the political
theorist’s intuition, reasoning, insights and experiences. In other words, philosophical speculation about values.
Empirical Conception – The theory rose to make the field of political theory scientific and objective and hence, a more reliable to guide for action. This new orientation came to be known as positivism. Under the
spell of positivism social scientists attempted to create a natural science of society and attain scientific
knowledge about political phenomena based on the principle which could be empirically verified and proved.
The popular trend of empirical conception – “Behavioral revolution” in 1950’s.
Contemporary Conception – Does not neatly follow the commonly accepted category of classification and does not stay within the particular tradition. In the course of building the theoretical edifice, the concept
breaks new grounds and create new sites for political investigation and also innovate new tools for searching
and establishing the principles of politics. Nonetheless, it does not move beyond the conceptions discussed
earlier; that is, historical, normative and empirical; but the mode of employing them has some hybridness in
character.
Approaches to political science
Approaches Scope of political studies
Behavioralism Concentrates on processes of politics associated with mainstream politics and
government
Rational choice
theory
Concerned with conditions for collective action in mainstream political world
Institutionalism Focus on the rules, norms and values that govern political exchanges; tends to look at
institutional arrangements in mainstream political world
Constructivism Politics is driven by the meanings that actors attach to their actions and their context.
Politics can be broad in scope reflecting people’s diverse world views about what it
involves
Psychology Views politics through the lens of the personality and cognition of the individuals who
engage in its practice, primarily within the mainstream world
Feminism A broad process definition that recognizes that the personal can be political
Marxism Politics is a struggle between social groups, in particular social classes

The Greeks and Romans
In Greece of Herodotus (c. 484-425 BCE) analysis of political ideas and ideals, and speculations about
the properties of different kinds of polities and the nature of statesmanship and citizenship, have
become part of conventional wisdom.
The history of political science properly begins with Plato (428–348 BCE) whose Republic, Statesman
and Laws are the first classics of political science. In these three studies, Plato sets out propositions
about justice, political virtue, the varieties of polity and their transformation which have survived as
political theories well into the 19th century and even until the present day.
In his first political typology, in the Republic, Plato presents his ideal regime based on knowledge and
possession of the truth, and hence exemplifying the rule of virtue, and he then presents four other
developmentally related regimes in descending order of virtue—Timocracy, Oligarchy, Democracy, and
Tyranny.
- Timocracy is a corruption of the ideal state in which honor and military glory supplant knowledge and virtue;
- Oligarchy is a corruption of Timocracy, replacing honor with wealth as the principle of recruitment;
- Democracy arises out of the corruption of oligarchy, and in turn is corrupted into tyranny.
Aristotle, Polybius & Cicero’s works on political philosophy
(Almond, 1998)
Plato distinguishes between the ideal
republic and the realistically possible
varieties of polity. To classify real regimes,
he introduces the famous three-by-two
table, marrying quantity and quality: the
rule of the one, the few, the many; each in
its pure and impure versions. That
generated the six-fold classification of
regimes—monarchy, tyranny, aristocracy,
oligarchy, democracy, ochlocracy—which
Aristotle perfected and elaborated in his
Politics, and which has served as a basic
taxonomy through the ages and into the
19th century.

Source: https://www.britannica.com/biography/Aristotle
Aristotle argues that “polity” or constitutional or “mixed” government, which is the
combination of oligarchy and democracy, and
which (because it virtue with stability) is the
best attainable form of government; and
tyranny, which is the worst. To back up his
argument he points out that, while the social
structures of cities vary according to the
economies, occupations, professions and
statuses contained in them, these differences
are reducible into different distributions of rich
and poor citizens. Where the rich dominate, we
have oligarchy; where the poor dominate, we
have democracy. Where the middle class
dominates, we may have “mixed” or
constitutional government, tending to be stable
since extreme interests are out-weighed by moderate ones.
(Almond, 1998)
Source: https://www.britannica.com/biography/Polybius
Polybius makes more explicit the developmental
ideas of Plato and Aristotle, offering simple
social psychological explanations for the decay
of the pure forms of monarchy, aristocracy and
democracy and for their degeneration into the
impure forms of tyranny, oligarchy and
ochlocracy. According to Polybius, the Roman
state builders had, through a process of trial and
error, rediscovered the virtues of the mixed
constitution—the combination of the
monarchic, aristocratic and democratic
principles implemented in the Consulate, the
Senate and the Assembly. It was these
institutions which made possible the conquest
of the world in the course of half a century, and
which according to Polybius guaranteed a future
of stable and just world rule under Roman law.
(Almond, 1998)
Source: https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cicero
The Roman lawyer Cicero (106–43 BCE), applied
“mixed constitution” theory to Roman history at a
time when the institutions of the Roman Republic
were already in deep decay. This part of his work
was an appeal for a return to the structure and
culture of the earlier Roman Republic prior to the
populist and civil war decades of the Gracchi,
Marius and Sulla. More significant and lasting was
his development of the Stoic doctrine of natural
law. This was the belief that there is a universal
natural law resulting from the divine order of the
cosmos and the rational and social nature of
humanity. It was his formulation of this natural law
idea which was taken up in the Roman law, and
passed from it into Catholic church doctrine and
ultimately into its Enlightenment and modern
manifestations.
(Almond, 1998)
Mixed Constitutions and Natural Law
Theory in History
Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) relates the mixed constitution to justice and stability through its
conformity to divine and natural law.
In the late middle ages and in the Renaissance, mixed government and natural law provide the
theoretical coinage according to which governments were valued. The stability, wealth and
power of Venice were taken as proof of the superiority of the mixed system.
The breakthrough of Renaissance political theory lay in Machiavelli's treatment of the
legitimacy of regimes and political leaders. While there was substantial progress in the
development of political science in the Enlightenment, such writers as Hobbes, Locke,
Montesquieu, Hume, Madison and Hamilton were pursuing the same themes that concerned
Plato, Aristotle, Polybius, Cicero, Aquinas, Machiavelli and Bodin — the forms and varieties of
rule, and the standards by which one judged them.
The variety of principalities and republics in northern Italy in these centuries, the overarching
and rival claims of Church and Empire, the warfare, conquest, revolution, diplomatic negotiation
and institutional innovation in which they were constantly engaged, stimulated several
generations of political theorists who reflected and wrote on this political experience.
(Almond, 1998)
The XIX Century
In the 17th and 18th centuries, the philosophers of the Enlightenment forecast the
improvement in the material, political and moral condition of humanity as a
consequence of the growth of knowledge. In the 19th and 20th centuries, scholars
and intellectuals elaborated this theme of progress and improvement, predicting
different trajectories, and causal sequences.
Linking European political theory with American political science of the first decades
of the 20th century was the concept of “pluralism,” a variation on the “mixed
government” theme. The concept of state sovereignty, associated with the ideology
of absolutist monarchy, was challenged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by
“pluralists” of both the right and the left.
(Almond, 1998)
Post-World War II trends and debates
“World War II turned out to be a laboratory and an important training
experience for many of the scholars who would seed the “behavioral
revolution.” The problems of how to insure the high rate of agricultural
and industrial production on the part of a reduced labor force, how to
recruit and train soldiers, sailors and airmen, and later how to discharge
and return them to civilian life, how to sell war bonds, how to control
consumption and inflation, how to monitor internal morale and the
attitudes of allies and enemies, created demand for social science
personnel in all the branches of the military and civilian services. The war
effort created pools of social science expertise which, on the conclusion of
the war, were fed back into the growing academic institutions of the post- war decades.”
(Almond, 1998)
What is the political legacy of WWII?
Long-term effects of wartime victimisation
World War II was the deadliest military conflict in history in terms of total dead, with some 75 million
people casualties including military and civilians, or around 3% of the world’s population at the time.
Many civilians died because of deliberate genocide, massacres, mass-bombings, disease, and starvation.
In addition to Nazi concentration camps, the Soviet gulags (labor camps) led to the deaths of 3.6 million
civilians.
The end of the Second World War did not signal a return to normality. On the contrary, it resulted in a
new conflict called the Cold War, which caused the long period of international tension, interspersed with
dramatic crises.
A representative sample of respondents across 35 countries in 2010, 65 years after the end of the war,
shows that a family history of wartime victimisation has systematically eroded political trust and the perceived legitimacy of institutions (Grosjean, 2014).
Trust in formal institutions has been found among the determinants of economic growth (Acemoglu 2005, Acemoglu et al. 2011, Besley and Persson 2009, 2010), market development (Greif 2012), economic liberalisation (Grosjean and Senik 2011), and post-conflict political recovery (Bigombe et al. 2000). Trust in others is also a factor in growth (Knack and Keefer 1997, Guiso et al., 2010), the functioning of markets (Fafchamps 2006), and institutional quality (Tabellini 2008, 2010).

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
Source: lumenlearning.com
www.un.org
The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization to promote
international cooperation established in 1945 after the end of WWII to replace
the ineffectual League of Nations.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) arose directly from the
experience of the World War II in Paris on 10 December 1948 and represents
the first global expression of a common standard of achievements for all
peoples and all nations.
The Declaration was explicitly adopted for the purpose of defining the
meaning of the words “fundamental freedoms” and “human rights”
appearing in the United Nations Charter, which is binding on all member
states. It sets out, for the first time, fundamental human rights to be
universally protected. Many international lawyers believe that the
Declaration forms part of customary international law and is a powerful tool
in applying diplomatic and moral pressure to governments that violate any
of its articles.

Author of Two Treatises of Government (1681, not
1690) and a Letter Concerning Toleration
Natural Law Theory rose among the Greeks, Romans &
Jews and is continued in Christian tradition, where thinkers
devise a theory of morality, right & justice from nature
(God) rather from the rules of society. And a good part of
the Enlightenment is commitment to the idea of science.
Not tradition, not superstition, not religion, not traditional
natural law, but science. Science is the basis for
reorganizing every aspect of human life. And the
Enlightenment political thinkers are all famous for, in one
way or another, wanting to come up with theories of
politics that are based on the appeal to science.
John Locke (1632 - 1704)
Known as Mòzǐ or “Master Mò,” lived in
Tengzhou, Shandong Province, China.
Like Confucius, Mò Dí traveled from state to state to
persuade rulers to adopt policies intended to end
war, alleviate poverty, install meritocracy, and
promote the welfare of all. The Mohists advocated
China’s first universalist, impartial ethic, and had a
significant influence on the epistemology, language,
logic, and political theory of early China.

Mò Dí (墨翟) c. 430 BCE.
Is often regarded as the founder of classical
utilitarianism.
He came upon “the principle of utility”, which states that any
action is right insofar as it increases happiness, and wrong insofar
as it increases pain. For Bentham, happiness simply meant
pleasure and the absence of pain and could be quantified
according to its intensity and duration.
Many of Bentham’s views were considered radical in Georgian
and Victorian Britain. His manuscripts on homosexuality were so
liberal that his editor hid them from the public after his death. He
was also an early advocate of animal welfare, famously stating
that their capacity to feel suffering gives us reason to care for
their wellbeing. As well as animal welfare and the
decriminalization of homosexuality, Bentham supported women’s
rights (including the right to divorce), the abolition of slavery, the
abolition of capital punishment, the abolition of corporal
punishment, prison reform and economic liberalization.6
Bentham also applied the principle of utility to the reform of
political institutions. Seeing progress in education within his own
society, he supported democratic reforms such as the extension
of the suffrage. He also advocated for greater freedom of speech,
transparency and publicity of officials as accountability
mechanisms. A committed atheist, he argued in favor of the
separation of church and state.

Jeremy Bentham (1748 - 1832)
John Stuart Mill (1806 – 1873)
Mill was influenced by the thought of both Jeremy
Bentham and political economist David Ricardo, and
committed to utilitarianism after reading Bentham’s
Traités de Legislation.
Mill was a committed advocate of social and political
reform. He was the second MP to call for women’s
suffrage and supported gender equality. He objected to
women being denied the vote not only because he
believed that it prevents them from advancing their
own interests, but also because it impedes the cultural
and intellectual development he thought happiness
consists in. He rejected all supposed “natural”
differences between men and women because any
observed differences are products of the unequal
environment in which women are raised. Mill’s staunch
support of women’s rights often attracted the criticism
of fellow Victorians, and at one point he was
imprisoned for distributing birth-control pamphlets. Mill also preferred more equal distributions of wealth
and supported various social welfare initiatives such as
labor unions and cooperatives.

What do you think is the major drawback
of the Utilitarian political theory?
When I say the word Marxism, what comes to
mind?
 Marxism as an ideology that by far is the single most powerful historical alternative to the liberal
tradition.
 Communist revolution of the 20th century had very little to do with Marx's actual ideas.
 Marx's Das Kapital is the only work that has ever rivaled the Bible for sales.
Karl Marx
(1818
–1883)
For Marx capitalism will eventually collapse and
will be replaced by socialism, which is a transitory
state to communism.
In the Communist Manifesto, his definition of
communism is
- a world in which the free
development of each is the condition for the free
development of all. That is to say, everybody
should be free but you can't be free if others are
unfree. In other words, if the condition for your
freedom is my lack of freedom then we don't have
a free society. And the central, organizing concept
of Marxism is actually the notion of exploitation. If
your freedom is parasitic or dependent upon
exploiting me, we don't have a free society. So, this
idea of communism is a world from which
exploitation will have been banished, and
therefore, we will all be free.
The concept of exploitation of working class, which is at the core
of the Marxist tradition is what differentiates the Marxist
tradition from others. It is the notion that for all of human history
people have one way or another been exploited.
Friedrich
Engels
(1820
– 1895)
Overall failures of Marxism
 Marx thought that communist revolutions would come in the advanced capitalists
countries. When in fact the revolutions baring his name came about in peasant societies.
And the advanced capitalist societies didn't fall apart either in the 19th century or the 20th
century, or indeed the 21st, at least so far. Formally communist countries like China and the Soviet Union have now become capitalist countries in a way that would surely have shocked
Marx.
 Marx's teleological view of history needs to be jettisoned, because history is mostly
unpredictable
 A socialist society was one in which people would be rewarded on the basis of their work
according to their ability. Whereas communism was going to be a world in which a need was
going to be the basis for redistribution or distribution, that everyone would work according
to their ability, but everybody's needs would be met.
What if my needs and wants are different from yours? What if I need my own spaceship to be
happy but my neighbor just a loaf of bread?
Social contract tradition
Social contract theory says that people live together in society in accordance
with an agreement that establishes moral and political rules of behavior. Some
people believe that if we live according to a social contract, we can live morally
by our own choice and not because a divine being requires it.
Contract implies the idea of agreement or consent as the forming the basis for
government.
At some point, social contract theory implies that people give up individual
freedom to do whatever they want in exchange for peace and protection.
Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679)
In his book Leviathan (1651) the core argument was
that it's not what people in fact agree to, but any
person who thinks clearly, who reflects on what it's
like to live without government must agree with.
That submitting to an absolute sovereign is better
than living in the state of nature. Thus, it’s an
agreement among people to give up their authority,
their power, their freedom to enforce, their wishes,
the law of nature, whatever it is that they think they
should be doing, to a third party, to their state, and
the state will have absolute power. In a word,
people should reduce their wills to one will.
But there are limits to what the government can do:
•People shouldn't be obliged to die for a sovereign.
•If a state can no longer protect you, then the obligation
to obey the government disappears.
Source: www.nationalreview.com
Locke’s most important and influential political writings
are contained in his Two Treatises on Government.
He thinks about consent as an actual agreement, not a
metaphor or a feature of rationality in the way that
Hobbes' stories. He says that once we have an actual
agreement, and any express declaration, given the
consent to be of any commonwealth, we're perpetually
and indispensably obliged to be and remain unalterably
subject to it, and can never again be of liberty in the
former state of nature. But if we've only tacitly
consented, which is what most people do, you're just
born into a country or you move into a country, then
you're at liberty to go and incorporate yourself into any
other commonwealth. So, tacit consent doesn't mean
you're obliged to the state.
John Locke (1632 - 1704)
plato.stanford.edu
Kant’s idea is that we should never use people
exclusively. People use one another all the time. He
understood that, but according to him, never treat
people exclusively as means to your own ends. Always
remember that they are ends in themselves. Another
way of putting it is the notion of universalizability.
He argues that the human understanding is the source
of the general laws of nature that structure all our
experience. Therefore, scientific knowledge, morality,
and religious belief are mutually consistent and secure
because they all rest on the same foundation of human
autonomy Immanuel Kant (1724 –1804)
iep.utm.edu
Rousseau has two distinct social contract theories. The first is an account
of the moral and political evolution of human beings over time, from a
State of Nature to modern society. The second is his normative, or
idealized theory of the social contract, and is meant to provide the means
by which to alleviate the problems that modern society has created for us.
His Social Contract begins with the most oft-quoted line from Rousseau:
“Man was born free, and he is everywhere in chains”, meaning that
humans are essentially free, and were free in the State of Nature, but the
‘progress’ of civilization has substituted subservience to others for that
freedom, through dependence, economic and social inequalities, and the
extent to which we judge ourselves through comparisons with others.
So, this is the fundamental philosophical problem that The Social Contract
seeks to address: How can we be free and live together? We can do so,
Rousseau maintains, by submitting our individual, particular wills to the
collective or general will, created through agreement with other free and
equal persons.
Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778)
Anti-Enlightenment Politics
The initial wave of hostility toward the Enlightenment peaked in the wake of the French
Revolution and the Terror, with figures such as Edmund Burke, Joseph de Maistre, and J. G.
Herder leading the charge in blaming the philosophes for their supposed radicalism, atheism,
and absolutism.
The rise and growth of contemporary opposition to the Enlightenment began when several
scholars writing in the mid-twentieth century accused it of being the main cause of the most
momentous problem the world was then facing: the emergence of totalitarianism.
The Enlightenment was also roundly criticized around this time by a number of conservative
thinkers who blamed it for undermining tradition and religion without putting anything in their
place other than a misguided confidence in reason.
Rasmussen, D (n.d.)
When I say the word conservative, what comes to mind?
Something that's focusing on tradition, inherited rights and practices, ways of doing things that have stood the test of time
and attributing importers to them for that very fact. One way to sum this up is to say that this is very much in the spirit of hostility
to the enlightenment.
http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/burke_edmund
After the French Revolution in 1789, Burke became
deeply hostile to science and to the idea that the
individual is the center of the universe. Burke points
out that people should think not about what we are
entitled to in some inherited sense but what is
expected of us to do.
Burke emphasised the dangers of mob rule, fearing
that the Revolution's fervour was destroying French
society by causing a devaluation of tradition and
inherited values, and a thoughtless destruction of the
material and spiritual resources of society.
He appealed to the British virtues of continuity,
tradition, rank and property and opposed the
Revolution to the end of his life.
Edmund Burke 1729 –1797)
Foucault attempted to expose the dark side of
the supposedly “humanitarian” and
“progressive” Enlightenment, and to show that
every apparent victory of Enlightenment ideals of
“freedom” and “reason” in fact resulted in new
and even more insidious forms of domination
and control. In his view, the Enlightenment
culminated not in the Nazi death camps or Soviet
gulags, but rather in the Panopticon, the model
prison designed by Jeremy Bentham in which
automatic and continuous surveillance exercises
discipline even more surely than did the dark
dungeons and corporal punishment of previous
ages. Paul-Michel Foucault (1926 –1984)
Rasmussen, D (n.d.)
What is democracy?
There is no absolute definition of democracy. The term is elastic
and expands and contracts according to the time,
place and circumstances of its use.
Greek: dēmokratiā - dēmos 'people’ & kratos 'rule’
 It is generally agreed that liberal democracies are based on four main principles:
• A belief in the individual: since the individual is believed to be both moral and rational;
• A belief in reason and progress: based on the belief that growth and development is the natural
condition of mankind and politics the art of compromise;
• A belief in a society that is consensual: based on a desire for order and co-operation not disorder and conflict;
• A belief in shared power: based on a suspicion of concentrated power (whether by individuals,
groups or governments).

Ancient Athenian democracy differs from the democracy that we
are familiar with in the present day. All citizens (with the pertinent
qualification of their being free men) were permitted the
opportunity of equal political participation: Important decisions
were made by the assembly, where each citizen had the right to
speak and the majority of offices were assigned by lot.
Professional prosecutors and judges did not exist in Ancient
Athens. Instead, it was left to the ordinary citizen to bring
indictments, act as jurors, and deliberate on the outcome of trials.
In 399BC Socrates was put on trial by a small group of fellow citizens
acting as democratic citizen-prosecutors. Thus, he stated that the
democracy is the rule by the ignorant.
Plato believed that expertise is the critical attribute of a leader; He
criticizes democracy of seldom producing such characters. Rather, it
elects popular spinsters who are effective in manipulating popular
opinion.
Plato, therefore, believed that philosophers (from Greek “love of
wisdom”) should rule, where a person is someone that is in love with
knowledge and the search for true reality.

Democracy is ineffective unless voters educate themselves on governing
decisions.
Democracy requires more time to implement changes.
Corruption - a democratic leader while in a position may have a

Nation and State. Forms of
government
Week 3
Diana Toimbek, Associate Professor, PhD
Definition of a State
State is a self-governing political entity with defined territory and permanent population
State comes from the Latin “status”, meaning "condition of a country“.
Any groups run by politics can be called a polity. The prefix for polity dates all the way back to
Greece, from the word politeia, which means "citizenship" or "government."
According to the
Montevideo
Convention’s (1933)
Article 1, The state as a
person of international
law should possess the
following qualifications:
A permanent population (people who live there on an ongoing basis)
•A defined territory (space or territory which has internationally recognized boundaries);
Government (has economic activity, trade regulations, public services, transportation system)
Capacity to enter into relations with the other states (sovereignty and external recognition
A state as regulator
Encyclopedia of Political Science
The regulation of some aspects of the life of the population living within the territory of the state through laws and norms is a permanent feature of
a state’s activity. However, the scope of the activities regulated by the state has varied across history.
According to Samuel E. Finer (1997), the first apparition of developed states goes back to around 3500 BCE, and during the following five
millennia the main activities of the state were the organization of armies for conquering new territories and defending from the attacks of other
states or groups of warriors, as well as the protection of public order and private property within the territory of the state.
After the Industrial Revolution, and especially after the WWII (1939–1945), it is much more difficult to say that public order, protection of
property rights, and organization for war are the main activities of the state.
Although the capacity of state’s penetration in society has varied through time, it is a constant that the state provides norms and regulations that
make social cooperation and economic exchanges possible.
A state and coercion
Encyclopedia of Political Science
States’ norms and regulations are backed, if necessary, by force. This leads us
to the second characteristic of the state: its coercive nature.
The coercive nature of the state is directed inside and outside the state’s
boundaries. Within the state’s boundaries, violence is applied to enforce norms
and regulations and, historically, to protect private property and eliminate
internal threats to the ruler in terms of dissent, rebellions, or terrorism.
A state as a collector of taxes
Encyclopedia of Political Science
Another characteristic of a state is it extracts resources from population through taxes. It is in exchange of these resources that the state
provides laws and regulations, social peace, and public goods such as roads and education. All these things make civilization possible.
However, there is frequently a contradiction between the action of the state as an extractor of resources and as a provider of laws,
regulations, and public goods.
Historically, most rulers have tended to maximize their revenues at the cost of providing inefficient laws and regulations. This means that
they extract more resources than it is needed to guarantee law, order, and provision of public goods, but also that they design property
rights and regulations that promote their interests but not the general interest of sustained growth.
This tension between maximization of the rulers’ revenue and creation of the necessary framework for the economy to flourish is the reason
why most states, although indispensable for economic growth, have been unable to guarantee vibrant economies.
A state and international relations
Encyclopedia of Political Science
Another characteristic of the state is that it is the most important unit in the system of international relations.
This means that states are recognized as such in the international arena by other states.
It can be argued that the insertion of a state in the international system of states has had an increasingly
important effect on the probability of a state’s survival.
While in previous centuries the weakness of the state and its inability to wage war, as we noted before, led
in most of the cases to its destruction at the hands of more powerful (as in the case with Dzungar Khanate).
In the contemporary world weak states have a good chance of survival through the fact of being recognized as
legitimate states by the international community, as is the case in many African states.
The internal roots of state power
Encyclopedia of Political Science
State power is based on sovereignty. Sovereignty, simply defined, is supreme power and authority to govern itself or another state.
For an actor to be recognized as having sovereignty, it typically has to have a degree of legitimacy (i.e., it is recognized by other actors as
the legal authority) and autonomy (i.e., it is independent, not controlled by another actor). For most of human history, sovereignty often
resided with individuals such as a monarch or with supranational organizations such as the Catholic Church.
The success of the nation-states resulted initially from their specific internal powers, namely control over the use of force, taxation,
and the regulation of civil society. As noted by Max Weber, the state had a recognized monopoly on the legitimate use of force within its
borders.
Control over the use of force allowed states to expand their military capabilities through standing armies and conscription. Meanwhile
taxation gave central governments the resources to expand control and reinforce their legitimacy through the development and
implementation of social and economic programs.
Independence allowed states to create domestic legal frameworks that regularized trade relationships and customs. Legal systems also
helped bolster the legitimacy of the government.
External rights of a state
A central right of a state and component of external sovereignty, is self-defense from external attack. The principle is one
of the oldest in international law and is enshrined in Article 51 of the 1945 United Nations (UN) Charter. The article
recognizes the right of states to engage in individual or collective self-defense, even prior to UN action in response to
aggression.
The state right of equality is the basis for international law. As equal actors, states have the right to control their foreign
policies, including entering into treaties with other states and international actors. Article 2 of the UN Charter specifically
notes the “equality” of states. This right is often questioned by lesser developed states who argue that the more
economically and militarily developed nations dominate contemporary international relations.
Encyclopedia of Political Science
Organization of states
Unitary states concentrate power at the central, or national, level. The United
Kingdom, France, China, and Japan are examples of unitary states.
Federal states create different divisions and levels of government and divide
power among those divisions and levels. The United States is a federal state, with
power accorded to offices at three levels: national or federal offices, state offices,
and local offices. Germany, India, Canada, Brazil, and Mexico also have federal
systems.
Whether travel is open or restricted, certain drugs are legal or illegal, military
service is required or optional, public prayer in schools is sanctioned or disallowed,
and race and ethnicity are relevant or irrelevant in university admissions, these and
similarly important questions are decided by the rules administered through
unitary or federal states in the form of laws, policies, regulations, and orders.
Definition of a Nation
Has been
derived from the
Latin word,
“natio”, which
means a “set of
people”.
‘Nation’ as a
word and a label
is still evolving,
and being applied
in new contexts.
Guibernau (1996, p. 47) has defined the nation as: ‘a human group conscious of forming
a community, sharing a common culture, attached to a clearly demarcated territory, having
a common past and a common project for the future and claiming the right to rule itself’.
French philosopher Ernest Renan in his 1882 essay “What Is a Nation?” stated that it is
“A heroic past, great men, glory [are the links between people] upon which one bases a
national idea. A nation is . . . a large-scale solidarity, constituted by the feeling of sacrifices
that one has made in the past and of those that one is prepared to make in the future.”
Some scholars have been portrayed nations as “imagined communities” (Benedict
Anderson’s term, 1983) with “social glue” serving in manipulating the masses, because it
gives limited perspectives to people in choosing their own identity (Encyclopedia of
Political Science)
The primordialist perspectives
According to primordialists, ethnicity is embedded in
inherited biological attributes, a long history of practicing
cultural differences, or both.
Anthony D. Smith (1996) defined the ethnie (a
feeling of kinship) as the core around which nations
are built. According to Smith, “National sentiment is
no construct. It has a real, tangible base. At its root is
a feeling of kinship, of the extended family, that
distinguishes the nation from every other kind of
sentiment.” Smith embraces a view of the nation as
an enduring community of “history and culture,
possessing a unified territory, economy, mass
education system, and common legal rights.”
According to the primordialist theory, nations will
never disappear. The main reason for the eternal
livelihood of nations is their ability to build on the
preexisting memories and ethnic myths that form
the basis of every community
John Coakley said that “primordialism may better
be viewed as an ingredient in nationalism than as an
explanation of nationalism.” (2017).
The perennialist perspectives
According to the theory “national identity”, along with the nation, is socially constructed.
They view nation as a product of dynamic and contentious historical process, which is not inherently linked to us but
rather owing its origins to pre-modern ethnic groups.
Neanderthals in our species' primal stages were not carrying around a blue flag with the golden Sun, steppe eagle and
ornaments. Issues of sovereignty and patriotism were not high on their agendas. Hence, they state that national identity
did not always exist; therefore, at some point, it was constructed.
In Imagined Communities by Benedict Anderson, the author stated that nations view themselves as having ancient origins, yet their formation has been a somewhat relatively recent development in society (the earliest emergence of
anything like the nation state was in the 16th century).
Ernest Gellner in his book Nations and Nationalism said “In fact, nations, like states, are a contingency, and not a universal necessity”.
Michael Billig in the book Banal Nationalism believed that a sense of national identity mirrored "society’s need for cultural belonging.“
Simone de Beauvoir invented the concept of "othering“, which generates parameters that allow or not allow people to
belong. Failure to meet criteria of a nation leads to people not being able to identify with a nation and society singling
them out as “other” or what is known as a minority. Their physical, political or religious traits mean that they do not fit in
with the majority, forcing them to endure living conditions inferior to that of the majority
Nationalism
Nationalism is the mobilization of a nation and support for its interests in pursuit of political goals.
These typically include national survival and self-rule (meaning that the rulers come from the same nation as the ruled).
Nowadays nationalism often has a negative meaning, where it implies an excessive, irrational
commitment to advancing the interests of one’s own nation at the expense of others. Adolf Hitler is
the prime example of nationalism pushed to the extreme.
Nationalism is compatible with a wide variety of political positions: forward looking or backward
looking, liberal or illiberal, egalitarian or racist.
Prior to the existence of nationalism, people were aware of themselves as being from a particular
place, being a member of a particular religious group, and being subject to a certain hierarchy of rule
(typically, a dynastic monarchy). But they were not aware of themselves as a nation in the modern
sense. As John Stuart Mill noted, in order for a people to rule itself (the literal meaning of
“democracy” in Greek), you have to first define who are “the people.”
After the Cold War abruptly ended in 1991, the shift toward democracy coincided with an increase,
not a decrease, in nationalist mobilization.
Encyclopedia of Political Science
Conflicts rooted in nationalism
Polish resistance against Soviet rule, which took the form of the Solidarity workers’ movement, was a direct continuation of the nationalist projects
of the nineteenth century. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania had been sovereign states after 1918 until their occupation by the USSR in 1940. Once
glasnost started to take hold in 1987, they began agitating for their independence.
Other nationalist conflicts erupted across the length and breadth of the Soviet Union: Kazakhs rioted because an ethnic Russian was appointed their
party boss; Armenians living in the province of Nagorno Karabakh fought for freedom from rule by Azerbaijan.
A similar fratricidal logic played out in Yugoslavia in 1991. One after another, the republics of the Yugoslav federation declared their independence:
Slovenia, Croatia, and then Bosnia. The Serbian minorities living in the latter two regions rose in revolt and received military support from the rump
Yugoslavia. Brutal fighting caused 200,000 deaths while millions fled their homes; finally fighting was stopped by a U.S.-led military intervention in
1995. A new phrase entered the English language: “ethnic cleansing.”
All around the globe, nationalist conflicts were erupting. The struggle for power between Tutsis and Hutus triggered the horrific genocide in
Rwanda in 1994.
There were secessionist conflicts under way in Asia (Kashmir, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and the Philippines) and Africa (Eritrea and Sudan).
The Arab-Israeli conflict—a battle between competing nationalisms—showed no sign of resolution that led to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in
2021.
The Gulf War (1990–1991) was fought to restore sovereignty to Kuwait and also created de facto self-rule for the Kurds of northern Iraq.
Even Latin America was not immune to these trends. A new assertiveness by indigenous peoples fueled regional insurrections from Mexico to
Bolivia.
Encyclopedia of Political Science
Is Nationalism Ethically Problematic?
(Grigsby , 2009).
Some believe that nationalism leads
to exclusionary and intolerant politics.
Others see nationalism as a positive
force, as an expression of the desire for
self-determination, and as a statement
of group pride.
Many political campaigns have not
always been motivated by nationalism.
Sometimes bigotry, territorial
expansion, state rivalries, or greed
motivated powerful groups to remove,
attack, or slaughter weaker ones.
States and Nations: relations & interactions
The relationship between the state and the nation also depends on whether one subscribes to
the structuralist point of view — that states make nations — or the constructivist point of view
— that nations make states. Despite these variations, the basic relationship between a nation
and a state is a symbiotic one, where the each benefits from the existence of the other.
medium.com
A nation and a state exist in a mutually dependent relationship with the nation
providing the identity and reason for existence of the state and the state
providing institutions to govern and secure the interests of the nation.
States and Nations: relations & interactions
Nations may or may not possess their own states. National identity, or nationalism, may precede the emergence of a
nation’s state. Zionism (Jewish nationalism) and a community of people identifying with a Jewish nation, for example,
existed before the creation of the state of Israel in 1948.
National identity may exist even though a nation lives within the territory of a separate state rather than within the
borders of a state conforming to the nation. This describes the historical situation of many French residents in the
Canadian province of Quebec.
Potential of nationalist movements force to a redrawing of state borders. E.g. Yugoslavia in the XX century.
The presence of a state can foster the development of nationalist sentiments or foster the weakening of nations. E.g.
the African state of Burundi, which gained independence from Belgium in 1962. Belgians pursued a “divide and conquer”
policy in Burundi whereby they favored the indigenous Tutsi over the indigenous Hutus. Belgians promoted racial myths of
Tutsi superiority and Hutu inferiority. Historically, however, the Tutsis and Hutus had not existed as separate nations; in
fact, they intermarried and shared common religions, language, and customs. Belgium’s colonial policy of creating
divisions between the two groups (as a means of serving its own interests in maintaining colonial dominance over both)
had an enormous impact. Tutsi and Hutus became enemies and began thinking of themselves as two separate peoples. As
a result, the violence swept through both Burundi and neighboring Rwanda
State policies can encourage indigenous nationalist identities in one context while weakening them in another. E.g.
Britain in Nigeria & Soviet Union in Kazakhstan
(Grigsby , 2009).
Major Differences between State and Nation
www.yourarticlelibrary.com
State is a Political Organisation while Nation is a social,
cultural, psychological, emotional and political unity.
Possession of a Definite Territory
is essential for the State but not
for a Nation.
Nation can be
wider than the
State.
There can be two or
more nationalities
living in one State.
The State uses police power (force) for preserving its
unity and integrity, the Nation is bound by strong
cultural and historical links
Nation is more
stable than State.
A State can be
created while a
Nation is always the
result of evolution.
Sovereignty is
essential for State
but not for Nation.
State and Government
The government is one element of the state. Government is the means by which state policy is
enforced, as well as the mechanism for determining the policy of the state. States are served by
a continuous succession of different governments.
The Constitution being the collection of basic rules, is the fundamental law according to which
the government of a state is organized.
There are governments with Aristarchy, autocratic, democratic, and monarchic attributes.
medium.com
Democratic Governments
Democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens have an equal say in the decisions
that affect their lives. Democracy allows people to participate equally—either directly or through elected representatives—in the proposal, development, and creation of laws. It encompasses social, economic, and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self- determination.
Direct democracy is a form of democracy in which people vote on policy initiatives directly. The
earliest known direct democracy is said to be the Athenian Democracy in the 5th century BCE,
although it was not an inclusive democracy; women, foreigners, and slaves were excluded from it. The
ancient Roman Republic’s “citizen lawmaking”—citizen formulation and passage of law, as well as citizen veto of legislature-made law—began about 449 BCE and lasted the approximately 400 years to the death of Julius Caesar in 44 BCE.
Representative democracy is a variety of democracy founded on the principle of elected people
representing a group of people. For example, three countries which use representative democracy
are the United States of America (a representative democracy), the United Kingdom (a constitutional
monarchy) and Poland (a republic). It is an element of both the parliamentary system and presidential
system of government and is typically used in a lower chamber such as the House of Commons (UK)
or Bundestag (Germany).

Non-Democratic Governments: Authoritarianism
An authoritarian government is characterized by highly concentrated
and centralized power maintained by political repression and the
exclusion of potential challengers. It uses political parties and mass
organizations to mobilize people around the goals of the regime.
Authoritarian regimes aren’t always easy to recognize. They might still
hold elections and have branches of government, but only a small group
holds the power.
Authoritarianism is marked by “indefinite political tenure” of an
autocratic state or a ruling-party state. An autocracy is a system of
government in which a supreme political power is concentrated in the
hands of one person, whose decisions are subject to neither external
legal restraints nor regularized mechanisms of popular control. Also, a
single-party state is a type of party system government in which a single
political party forms the government and no other parties are permitted
to run candidates for election.
courses.lumenlearning.com
Non-Democratic Governments: Totalitarianism
Totalitarianismis an extreme version of authoritarianism. Authoritarianism primarily differs
from totalitarianism in that social and economic institutions exist free from governmental
control. By contrast, totalitarianism is a political system where the state holds total authority
over the society and seeks to control all aspects of public and private life wherever necessary.
The term ‘an authoritarian regime’ denotes a state in which the single power holder
monopolizes political power. However, a totalitarian regime attempts to control virtually all
aspects of the social life, including economy, education, art, science, private life, and morals of
citizens.

Non-Democratic Governments: Dictatorship
A dictatorship is defined as an autocratic form of government in which the
government is ruled by an individual: a dictator. In contemporary usage, dictatorship
refers to an autocratic form of absolute rule by leadership unrestricted by law,
constitutions, or other social and political factors within the state.
Hence, a dictatorship (government without people’s consent ) is a contrast to
democracy (government whose power comes from people) and totalitarianism
(government controls every aspect of people’s life) opposes pluralism (government
allows multiple lifestyles and opinions).
A totalitarian dictatorship is even more oppressive and attempts to control all
aspects of its subjects’ lives through fear and intimidation; including occupation,
religious beliefs, and number of children permitted in each family. Citizens may be
forced to publicly demonstrate their faith in the regime by participating in marches
and demonstrations.

Non-Democratic Governments: Monarchy
A monarchy is a form of government in which sovereignty is actually or nominally embodied in
a single individual, the monarch. This is a form of government in which a state or polity is ruled
or controlled by an individual who typically inherits the throne by birth and rules for life or until
abdication. Monarchs may be autocrats (absolute monarchy) or ceremonial heads of state who
exercise little or no power or only reserve power, with actual authority vested in a parliament or
other body such as a constitutional assembly.

Oligarchy is a form of power structure in which power effectively rests with a small number of people. These people could
be distinguished by royalty, wealth, family ties, education, corporate, or military control. Such states are often controlled by a few prominent families who pass their influence from one generation to the next.
Oligarchies often have authoritative rulers and an absence of democratic practices or individual rights.
E.g., The government that ruled South Africa from 1948 to 1991 was a racially constructed oligarchy. The minority white population exercised dominance and imposed segregation over the nation's majority Black population, controlling policy,
public administration, and law enforcement.
Oligarchs who achieved their wealth after the fall of the Soviet Union by monopolizing economic actives and political
power, also considered an oligarchy.
Since the political control and government is in the hands of a few elite individuals of the Communist Party of China, China is
considered an oligarchy. The Communist Party of China has hold of the government, with five main members controlling most
government facets.
Unique among oligarchies, the government of Saudi Arabia is run by the royal family left from the Saudi Kingdom. The makeup of the government includes the descendants of the royal family. These descendants use their power and wealth to
maintain control over the oil industry.
While not all economists agree, a recent Princeton and Northwestern University study showed that the United States was
also an oligarchy. This was due to the wealthy elite having more rule over the country than general citizens.

Non-Democratic Governments: Oligarchy
Theocracy is a form of government in which official policy is governed by immediate divine
guidance or by officials who are regarded as divinely guided, or is pursuant to the doctrine of a
particular religion or religious group. Theocracy essentially means rule by a religious leadership; a
state in which the goal is to direct the population towards God and in which God himself is the
theoretical “head of the state”.
One of the most well-known theocratic governments was that of Ancient Egypt. In Egypt, the pharaoh was seen as a divine connection to the gods. They were actually thought of as descending
from the god Ra. Though it is divided into different periods, the theocratic monarchy of Egypt lasted
for about 3,000 years.
Prior to 1959, the Tibetan government was headed by the Dalai Lama. This Buddhist leader is
considered to be a reincarnation of the previous Dalai Lama. He is seen as a ruling god. There have
only been 14 Dalai Lamas throughout history. The reincarnation of the Dalai Lama is chosen by the
High Lamas through a dream, smoke or holy lake.
Modern theocracy examples include Iran, Vatican, Saudi Arabia

Indigenous tribes around the globe use a form of government called tribalism. In this form of
government, you follow the dictates and rules of your tribe, which is made of specific people
groups or those with the same ideals. There can be a council of elders making decisions, but not
always. Each tribes make up is unique. While tribalism is becoming less and less common, tribes
in Africa still use this form of government.

Economically Driven Types of Government
Capitalism
While capitalism is actually a type of
economy, many times, it works to drive a
government and political power. In
capitalism, the government doesn’t run
the economy; instead, private-ownership
corporations and businesses do.
Communism
A theory created by Karl Marx,
communism is where everything is
publicly owned rather than privately like
in capitalism. It’s an attempt to create a
classless society, but it typically happens
through a violent revolution.
Socialism
Socialism and communism form from the
same ideals of Karl Marx for a utopian,
classless society. However, socialism
places emphasis on making small
changes through reforms and laws.
Additionally, communism doesn’t
recognize private property, while in
socialism, you can own property, but
industry is regulated by the government.

What is political philosophy?
Philosophy is essentially not possession of the truth, but quest for the truth. Thus, political philosophy
is the branch of philosophy devoted to reflecting on the contents, values, and conditions of political
life. Political philosophies are distinguished by their different conceptions of political dialogue.
The domain of political philosophy is defined by a series of classic texts, such as Aristotle’s
Politics, Hobbes’ Leviathan, Rawls’ A Theory of Justice and along with a conventional list of the problems to be addressed – the acceptable limits of state actions, the basis of political obligations, the virtues of citizenship, and the nature of social justice.
Political ideologies have two dimensions: theoretical one and operative one. While the
operative one is taken from reality and circumstances, the theoretical one is taken from
political philosophy.
So there is no ideology without a political philosophy on which it was built. Political
philosophy becomes transformed to an ideology – into an action-oriented movement. Yet
there is political philosophy with no ideology. (E.g., K. Marz and V. Lenin).
In its essence not to be neutral but to raise a claim to a people’s obedience, allegiance, decision or
judgement.
Science of
ideas
All of us have an ideology. Because we all believe in
certain things and value somethings – family, friends, property, the law, freedom or authority.
We all have prejudices, even those who claim to be free
of them. We look at the world in one way or another
and have “ideas” about it – and we try to make sense out of what is going on in it.
“Like-minded” people with the same ideas about the world, society, and its values, who like the same things
and have similar prejudices band together. They gather
in clubs, mosques, movements...
Thus, we are sensitive to appeals made to us – honor,
patriotism, family, religion, pocketbook, race, ethnicity,
gender, or race.
We are creators and creatures of ideas, of ideologies,
and through them we manipulate others or are
ourselves manipulated. So, ideologies are very much a
part of our lives.
(Macridis, 1992)
Ideology has been defined as ‘a set of closely related beliefs, or ideas, or even
attitudes, characteristic of a group or community’. It is also ‘a set of ideas and
beliefs’ that people hold about their political regime and its institutions and their
own position and role in it (Macridis, 1992).
Ideologies shape people’s thoughts and actions with regard to many things,
including nationality, race, the role and function of government, property and class
divisions, the relations between men and women, human responsibility for the
natural environment, and more.
These systems of ideas have proven to be potent, and often lethal, political forces.
As the historian Isaiah Berlin observed in his 1992 book The Crooked Timber of
Humanity, “the great ideological storms” of the twentieth century “have altered
the lives of virtually all mankind,” producing not only revolutions but “totalitarian
tyrannies of both right and left and . . . explosions of nationalism, racism, and, in
places, of religious bigotry. . . . These great movements began with ideas in
people’s heads: ideas about what relations between men have been, are, might be,
and should be; and . . . [these ideas were] transformed in the name of a vision of
some supreme goal in the minds of the leaders, above all of the prophets with
armies at their backs” (p. 1) (as cited in The Encyclopedia of Political Science).
Political ideology accordingly appears synonymous to ‘political culture’ or ‘political
tradition’ (Macridis, 1992).
History of ideology
The word first made its appearance in French as idéologie at the time of the French Revolution, when it was introduced by a philosopher, A.-L.-C.
Destutt de Tracy.
de Tracy drew on the ideas of John Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690, where he had argued that the mind is like a tabula rasa, or
blank slate, in that people are born with no knowledge or ideas; everything we know and every idea we have is thus the result of sense experience. de Tracy took this claim about the nature of knowledge as the starting point for his own science of ideas, or ideologie.
If ideas are the result of experience, he reasoned, it must be possible to discover their sources and explain how people come to have the ideas that
they have—including the false and misleading ideas that stand in the way of freedom and progress. Among these were religious ideas, which he
regarded as mere superstitions.
Catholic Church, the nobility, and powerful political elites viewed ideologie and the “ideologues,” as de Tracy’s followers were called, with alarm. With its emphasis on rationality and science, ideologie posed a threat to traditional authority in politics and society as in religion.
But it was Napoleon Bonaparte (1769–1821) who quashed de Tracy’s attempt to found a reforming science of ideas. Once a supporter of the
ideologues, Napoleon changed positions in the early 1800s when, as self-proclaimed emperor of France, he needed the support of the church and the
nobility.
Karl Marx (1818–1883) used the concept some forty years later, referring to a set or system of ideas that served to justify and legitimize the rule of a dominant social class.
What people think—not just the ruling class but everyone — may depend on their social positions. In his Ideology and Utopia (1929), Mannheim called for a “sociology of knowledge” to trace the social origins of ideas and beliefs.
To many, ideology remains a pejorative term. In their view, ideologies are bad because they always simplify and distort matters. Worse yet, ideologues
use emotion-rousing slogans and simplistic analyses to persuade people that their ideology has a monopoly on the truth.
In contrast to this negative view, many people now use ideology in a neutral fashion. In such cases, ideology means a more or less consistent set of
ideas, beliefs, and convictions about how the social world does and should operate.
The Encyclopedia of Political Science
Ideology: The Building Blocks
The Individual Political ideologies are addressed to each one of us; they all begin with one preconception or another about us – about human nature.
The Nature of Truth Human beings are deprived of the freedom to seek truth, to experiment with
new ideas, to confront each other with different points of view, and to live in a
system that tolerates different ways
The Individual and
Society
The individuals are perceived as part of a group whose protection and survival
require cooperation.
Political Authority Belief in one overriding truth almost always leads to an authoritarian position
(elitist). It assumes that a small group ‘knows’ and is capable of governing on the
basis of certain qualities
Equality and Property Many political ideologies can be distinguished in terms of the answers they try to
provide: Who produces and who decides what is produced? Who gets what and
how much?
Major political ideologies
The Encyclopedia of Political Science lists
around 60 ideologies.
However, we are going to discuss the most
famous ones:
Liberalism
Socialism
Conservatism
Liberalism •Liberalism is often treated as if it is a ‘complex of doctrines’ that cannot be simplified (Geuss, 2002). So we are
told that it involves an enthusiasm for freedom, toleration, individualism and reason, on the one hand, and a
disapproval of power, authority and tradition, on the other (Dunn, 1993).
•Or that it involves ‘the idea of limited government, the maintenance of the rule of law, the avoidance of arbitrary
or discretionary power, the sanctity of private property and freely made contracts, and the responsibility of
individuals for their own fates’, complicated by ‘state involvement in the economy, democracy, welfare policies,
and moral and cultural progress’ (Ryan, 1995). All these authors agree that liberalism is not simple.
•Some older definitions of liberalism sound like definitions of anarchism. L. T. Hobhouse (1911, p. 123) yet
although listed many ‘elements’ of liberalism, expressed reluctance to give any of them priority. He nonetheless
located the ‘heart’ of liberalism in the belief ‘that society can safely be founded on a self-directive power of
personality’.
•Perhaps the best way to express this is to say that the liberal always divides the world into three: into what is
intrinsically necessary (the self ), what is necessary to support that intrinsic necessity (a system of standards,
rules, laws), and what is contingent (everything else, including all other beliefs, practices and institutions).
•Liberalism is the fundamental form of modern ideology because of the apparent simplicity of its criterion. The
direct appeal to the self, especially the reason of that self (whether understood as rationality or reasonableness),
is what made enlightenment possible. It also explains why the liberal is usually far clearer in argument than the
socialist or the conservative.
(Alexander, 2014)
Socialism
•In a purely socialist system, all legal production and distribution decisions are made by the government, and
individuals rely on the state for everything from food to healthcare. The government determines the output and
pricing levels of these goods and services.
•Socialists contend that shared ownership of resources and central planning provide a more equal distribution of
goods and services and a more equitable society. Socialism recognises that we are not mere selves, but selves in
a situation, in a society – and that it is to these selves that a debt is owed. The self is no longer a merely selfish self, but a self constituted by its existence in society.
•Socialist ideals include production for use, rather than for profit; an equitable distribution of wealth and material
resources among all people; no more competitive buying and selling in the market; and free access to goods and
services.
•Socialism remains as significant as ever as a fundamental ideological possibility (Dunn, 1984). Yet the more
abstract or argumentative socialism becomes the more it tends to liberalism, and the more actual or historical it
becomes the more it tends to conservatism
•Capitalism, with its belief in private ownership and the goal to maximize profits, stands in contrast to socialism.
•While socialism and capitalism seem diametrically opposed, most capitalist economies today have some socialist
aspects.
•Examples of socialist countries include the Soviet Union, Cuba, China, and Venezuela.
Kenton, 2021
Conservatism
As Edmund Burke (1999, p. 193) put it, we have to see ourselves as involved in ‘a partnership not only
between those who are living, but between those who are living, those are dead, and those who are to be
born’.
Conservatives argue that there is no obligation to change the world because human imperfection, on the
one hand, and unforeseen consequences, on the other, make it impossible to know that any change will be
for the better (Stove, 2003). If we do change anything, it should be in terms of the considered judgements
of the past, for the reason that we cannot depend on our own experience.
As many have observed, resistance to change is the abstract concept or negative moment of conservatism.
Because ‘the highest virtue in politics is to resist change until change becomes inevitable, and then to
concede to it with as little fuss and as much obeisance to tradition as possible’ (Utley, 1989, p. 87).
In general characteristic, conservatives reject the optimistic view that human beings can be morally
improved through political and social change. Skeptical conservatives merely observe that human history,
under almost all imaginable political and social circumstances, has been filled with a great deal of evil. Far
from believing that human nature is essentially good or that human beings are fundamentally rational,
conservatives tend to assume that human beings are driven by their passions and desires—and are
therefore naturally prone to selfishness, anarchy, irrationality, and violence. Accordingly, conservatives look
to traditional political and cultural institutions to curb humans’ base and destructive instincts.
(Alexander, 2014)

The guiding theme of political philosophies and political ideologies is the regime, which means simultaneously the form of
life of a society, its style of life, its moral taste, form of society, form of state, form of government, spirit of laws (Strauss,
1957).
The difference between political system and political regime
Political system is a form of governance (the set of formal legal institutions that constitute a
“government” or a “state.” ).
Political regime is an actual government run by groups of politicians and their supporters
(principles, norms, rules, and decision-making procedures that regulate the operation of a
government and its interactions with society).
What kind of political systems you remember from the Lecture 3?
Conceptual foundations of regime types
‘Political regime’ is a concept commonly used in the social sciences to denote
the pattern of rules, norms, and decision-making procedures among state
officials and between state officials and society.
We cannot directly observe a ‘regime’ but instead we can create a concept that
captures the pattern of political relationships in a given society.
Normally, these patterns are translated into discrete categories, such as
‘democracies’ or ‘autocracies’. Researchers are usually interested in such
categorical measures for purposes of identifying regime types and instances of
regime change – including, but not limited to, the method by which national
leaders are chosen, passage of a constitutional amendment, creation of a new
law, addressing political opposition, declaration of a state of emergency, etc.
Many existing datasets classify regimes by institutional characteristics. For example, Freedom
House measures ‘political rights’ or ‘civil liberties’ to categorize regimes as democratic.
Limitations of regime classifications
In September 1990, Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda allowed competitive,
democratic, multiparty elections. In October 1991, Frederick Chiluba won the
presidency in elections widely considered fair. Kaunda stepped down and Zambia
made a successful transition from one-party rule to a competitive, multiparty system.
Zambia was deemed a model of democracy on a continent then rife with
dictatorships and military juntas.
Later, Chiluba began to threaten violence and imprison members of opposition
groups. He had Kaunda jailed at a maximum security prison on charges that he was
stoking revolutionary fervor and was involved in a coup plot. Parliament members
resigned by the dozen, citing rampant corruption and economic mismanagement.
He also engineered constitutional amendment to prevent Kaunda from running for
presidency again and invoked a law that prohibits ‘defamation’ of the president.
The mix of authoritarian and democratic elements that coexist in Chiluba’s Zambia
are increasingly common in many recent regimes and suggest the importance of
accommodating a wider variety of indicators and categories by which to classify
regimes.
(Reich, 2002)
Modern regime classifications
Democracy
• A regime in which (i) meaningful and extensive
competition exists among individuals and organized
groups for all effective positions of government power,
at regular intervals and excluding the use of force; (ii) a
highly inclusive level of political participation exists in
the selection of leaders and policies, such that no major
(adult) social group is excluded; and (iii) a sufficient level
of civil and political liberties exists to ensure the integrity
of political competition and participation.
Semi-democracy
• A regime in which a substantial degree of political
competition and freedom exist, but where the effective
power of elected officials is so limited, or political party
competition is so restricted, or the freedom and fairness
of elections are so compromised that electoral
outcomes, while competitive, still deviate significantly
from popular preferences; and/or civil and political
liberties are so limited that some political orientations
and interests are unable to organize and express
themselves.
Authoritarian
• A regime in which little or no meaningful political
competition or freedom exists.
In addition to these three types, countries that are in the process of transition from one regime type to another are coded as ‘transitional’. A
transitional period occurs when deliberate and ultimately successful efforts are made by, or with the clear acquiescence of, top government
officials to engineer a change from one of the above regime types to another. Other regimes also include military, civil, secular & theocratic ones.
Ideology, Social bases & National Movements
National movement has a very wide connotation and may be applied to any nation-wide struggle
that the masses consider to be in the interest and for the welfare of their nation. They are
achieved by persistent protest, “passive resistance”, revolution, civil war and colonial war.
Ideologies provide an important psychological and emotional base from which individuals can
derive meaning and significance for their own participation in a changing society.
An ideology that is increasingly accepted performs the vital function of building common beliefs
and attitudes among the political elites and masses, uniting the different groups within society in
the pursuit of shared goals. Of the several principal ideologies of national movements, therefore,
that of nationalism is the most pervasive and important.
Every strata of society has had some role in the progress of national movements (E.g., National
liberation movement, peasants, workers, women, minorities).

Power, Authority and
Political Institutions
Week 5
Diana Toimbek. Associate Professor, PhD
Introduction
There are 3 aspects of state – force, power and authority.
In general terms, power is an entity or individual’s ability
to control or direct others, and authority is influence that is
predicated on perceived legitimacy.
Pittacus (c. 640–568 B.C.E.) opined, “The measure of a man
is what he does with power,” and Lord Acton perhaps more
famously asserted, “Power tends to corrupt; absolute
power corrupts absolutely” (1887).
German sociologist Max Weber said that power is the
ability to exercise one’s will over others (Weber 1922).
Power affects more than personal relationships; it
shapes larger dynamics like social groups,
professional organizations, and governments.
Authority refers to accepted power—that is, power that
people agree or are obliged to follow. Besides formal
offices, authority can arise from tradition and personal
qualitiesSource: courses.lumenlearning.com
Power: Meaning of the concept
Meaning of politics has changed from one of being a “study of state and government” to that of
being a “study of power”. Power is seen in different aspects of life - in the structures of
government administration, bureaucracy, elections, society and family.
In political theory, power is the central issue, whether it is clothed in law that qualifies it or
whether authority that compels obedience to it, because it is concerned about the state, which
is force.
In international relations, power is the capacity to of a state to influence or promote the
behavior or agenda to other states for the purpose of ensuring various interests.
Power capacity includes skills and techniques in the use of consent and constraint, as well as
persuasion and influence, sometimes threat or coercion to gain ascendancy over other states.
Some states are characterized as ‘haves’ and the others as ‘have-nots’. The former is well- endowed with assets of power, while the latter seek to better their position at the expense of
the ‘haves’. This situation gives power struggle its essential character.
Legal concept of power
The ones who regard the state as a legal association argue that notion of imperative and
superior force associated with the state is not arbitrary; but it is qualified force: it is force
exercised ‘in the name of law’. Thus, power is force expressed in terms of law; it is force
qualified and expressed in a regular manner.
As in any given political community, there exists a supreme power from which the law emanates
(Summa potestas as Cicero calls it). This supreme power is also described as ‘sovereignty’ ,
which conception implies to the final authority of a state. Hence, sovereign power converts the
rule of force into the rule of law.
The transition from the ‘state of nature’ to the ‘civil state’ is the transition from the rule of force
(where there is limited security) to that of law, where human relations are secure.
State is a sovereign power – means that its rules, regulations and laws have final authority.
Hence, legal sovereignty treats the state as a final legal authority.
For Friedrich, power is ‘a certain kind of human
relationship’, while for Tawney, ‘it is the capacity of an
individual or a group to modify others’ conduct as one
desires’.
‘acts… affecting or determining other
acts’.
Harold Lasswell & Abraham Kaplan
Gandhi, an apostle of peace, regarded power as
the power of love and truth.
Communist leader Mao Zedong
thought of power as “flowing from
the barrel of the gun”,
‘What is power, but the ability or
faculty of doing a thing?’
Alexander Hamilton
The Power Theory
In Liberal Democratic Theory, power has been identified with developmental and extractive
capacities. In other words, power means ability of use and development of human capacities. It has
two aspects, extractive and developmental, which can be called ethical and empirical dimensions,
respectively. Since a man’s ability to use and develop his capacities becomes the “power”, it is called
man’s developmental power and it has a qualitative character. Besides, man should use his capacities
in a way so that he may extract benefits from others. It leads to the idea of extractive power.
Marxian Theory. Karl Marx viewed political power as being possessed by those who control the
means of production as compared to the labour force which has little or no control over such means
of production. This “relation of production”, therefore, determines the distribution of political power.
In the Communist Manifesto, Marx and Engels state that political power, so called, is merely the
organized form of one class oppressing another, and that political power is the general and pervasive
power which a dominant class exercises in order to maintain and defend its predominance in a civil
society. Marx sees a close integration between political power and the prevailing socioeconomic
system and regards it as transient — it shall disappear with the rise of the stateless and classless
society.
Distinction between Power and related themes
Force
• It is the most brutal
manifestation of power.
The techniques involved
in physical force are
restraint, coercion,
threat, intimidation,
blackmail, terrorism and
military domination. So
power can be called
latent force, while force
is manifest power.
Influence
• It represents the
sublimation of power. It
may be due to social
prestige, intellectual and
spiritual eminence, high
morality and etc. So,
while influence is
persuasive, power is
coercive.
Control
• It is more
comprehensive and less
concentrated than
power. Control could be
of a different nature like
legislative, executive,
judicial, financial and
etc. Power is more
intense, when compared
to control.
Authority
The recognition of the power exercised as per definite
rules implies the recognition of an obligation to
submit to these rules. The word ‘state’ in this sense
provides a term of reference for these obligations.
It refers not merely to a force which exists in actual
fact, or to power which makes itself felt in accordance
with certain rules, but to an authority which is
recognized as warranted and justified in practice.
Authority is an institutionalized power.
Classification system for authority by Max Weber
The power of traditional
authority is accepted because
that has traditionally been
the case; its legitimacy exists
because it has been accepted
for a long time (Queen
Elizabeth II).
The power of charismatic authority are
drawn to the leader’s personal qualities. The
appeal of a charismatic leader can be
extraordinary, and can inspire followers to
make unusual sacrifices or to persevere in
the midst of great hardship and persecution.
They usually emerge in times of crisis and
offer innovative or radical solutions, or even
a vision of a new world order.
Power made legitimate by laws, written
rules, and regulations is termed rationallegal authority. In this type of authority,
power is vested in a particular rationale,
system, or ideology and not necessarily
in the person who implements the
specifics of that doctrine. A nation that
follows a constitution applies this type of
authority.
Authority is the right to do a thing. It is
understood as a form of power. In order to elicit
voluntary or willing obedience, essential to effect
changes, authority has to lay claims to being
right. Legitimacy provides to authority, the
quality of correctness and justness, invoking
thereby, obedience and compliance as a matter of
duty rather than as an outcome of coercion and
force. Thus, authority when associated with
legitimacy, may be thought of as “legitimate
power”.
Distinction between the concepts of
Power and Authority
Prof. Raphael in his Problems of Political
Philosophy distinguishes three meanings of the
term “power”. First, the most general meaning of
power is simply ability. Secondly, we speak of
power in a social context, when we think of
power as a specific kind of ability i.e. the ability
to make other people do what one wants them to
do. Thirdly, there is coercive power which is
using the threat of superior force to make others
do what one wants them to do when they are
unwilling. Because coercive power is so
prominent in political conflict, the word “power”
which at first meant ability of any kind, has come
to be associated with enforcement.
How authorities exercise their legal power
determines political institutions in a state
Political institutions are the organizations in a government that create, enforce, and apply laws. They often
mediate conflict, make (governmental) policy on the economy and social systems, and otherwise provide
representation for the population.
The ability of the state to provide these institutions is therefore an important determinant of how well individuals
behave in markets and how well markets function. Successful provision of such institutions is often referred to as
“good governance”.
Good governance includes the provision of sound macroeconomic policies that create a stable environment for
market activity. It also means the absence of corruption, which can subvert the goals of policy and undermine the
legitimacy of the public institutions that support markets.
Good governance matters for growth and poverty reduction. Many studies have documented strong associations
between per capita incomes and measures of the strength of property rights and the absence of corruption. To a
certain extent, this reflects the greater capacity of rich countries to provide good institutions. But recent findings
also point to a strong effect running from better governance to better development outcomes.
Good governance requires the power to carry out policies and to develop institutions that may be unpopular
among some—or even a majority—of the population.
The World Bank. Political Institutions and Governance
Why Nations Fail: The
Origins of Power,
Prosperity, and Poverty
by Daron Acemoglu and
James A. Robinson.
Why are some countries poor and others experience the highest living
standards?
Is it climate, geography, culture, or could it be the ignorance of domestic
leaders? Acemoglu and Robinson suggest it’s none of these – rather, the
real reason behind the poverty trap and significant between-nation
differences lies in the role of political institutions.
The authors argue that political institutions that can be either inclusive — focused on power-sharing, productivity, education, technological advances and the well-being of the nation as a whole and create the incentives that lead to sustained development and poverty reduction; or
extractive — bent on extracting wealth and resources away from a nation and removing the majority of the population from participation in
political or economic affairs (limited access to quality education or
economic opportunities, and no ability or incentive to use their talents
or skill).
Throughout history, extractive institutions have typically led to stagnant
economic growth. Even though certain societies (for example, the USSR)
have achieved some level of economic growth under extractive methods,
they do not achieve long-term, stabilized economic growth. In fact, the countries which have developed long-term growth patterns did so with the parallel, gradual development of inclusive institutions, enabling large
swathes of the population to participate in the political and economic
systems of the country.

Politics of oppression
Week 6
Diana Toimbek. Associate Professor, PhD
It is vital that all rights-based development cooperation should
promote respect for human rights and democracy.
THE EQUAL WORTH of all people and the right to live in
freedom applies to the whole of humanity. Thus the struggle
for freedom is never ‘won’; it must be continually renewed.
Any society is influenced by belief systems and governmental
policies that led to one or another kinds of oppression.
Social change continues to be the thread we must use to
construct new realities.
“….the definition and critical analysis of oppression has left
out the complexity, voices and lived experiences of individuals
who have been severely impacted by injustice and
oppression…”
– Bell Hooks (1994)
Definition
Oppression has been variously defined as a state or a process.
As a state or outcome, oppression results "from along-term and
consistent denial of essential resources" (Watts & Abdul-Adil, in
press). This situation is usually described as a state of domination
where the oppressed suffer the consequences of deprivation,
exclusion, discrimination, and exploitation (e.g., Bartky, 1990;
Sidanius, 1993; Young, 1990).
A definition of oppression as process is given by Mar'i (1988):
"Oppression involves institutionalized collective and individual
modes of behavior through which one group attempts to
dominate and control another in order to secure political,
economic, and/or social-psychological advantage" (p. 6).
Another important distinction in the definition of oppression
concerns its political and psychological dimensions. Psychological
and political oppression co-exist and are mutually determined.
(Prilleltensky & Gonick, 1996)
Political oppression,
which is the creation of material,
legal, military, economic, and/or
other social barriers to the
fulfilment of self-determination,
distributive justice, and
democratic participation, results
from the use of multiple forms of
power by dominating agents to
advance their own interests at
the expense of
persons or groups in positions of
relative powerlessness
Psychological oppression,
in turn, is the internalized view
of self as negative and as not
deserving more resources or
increased participation in
societal affairs, resulting from
the use of affective, behavioral,
cognitive, linguistic, and cultural
mechanisms designed to solidify
political domination
(Prilleltensky & Gonick, 1996)
“Oppression [is] both a process and a dynamic state with codetermining psychological and political factors that manifest
themselves in terms of self-determination, distributive justice, and collaboration and democratic participation.” (p. 132)

Political and Psychological Dynamics of Oppression
Absolutism
Absolutism is a historical term for a form of government in which the
ruler is an absolute authority, unrestricted by any other institution, such
as churches, estates, a constitution, laws, or opposition.
Political philosophers of the 16th and 17th centuries reacted by
introducing concepts of the natural law or the divine right of kings.
Although contradictory, both concepts claimed that unquestionable rule
by a single person was the best form of government.
Absolutism went through several historical stages, such as early
absolutism, confessional absolutism, court absolutism, and Enlightened
absolutism.
Absolutism is characterized by the end of feudal partitioning,
unification and centralization of the state, rise of professional standing
armies and professional bureaucracies, and the codification of state
laws. The general rise of state power was demonstrated by expensive
lifestyles of absolute monarchs who identified with the state. Absolutist
monarchs attempted to intervene personally in every area; welfare of
the state was therefore determined by their (in)competence.
Slavery The practice of slavery has occurred in many civilizations throughout
human history and was caused by social stratification, economic factors,
and high population density. Perhaps most noteworthy of places it
occurred were ancient Egypt, China, India, Greece, and the Roman
Empire. During the Roman Empire alone, it is estimated that one
hundred million people were captured or sold as slaves.
Slavery developed in many ways, including as a means of repaying
debts, as punishment for crime, as treatment of prisoners of war, and
due to child abandonment. But the trading of slaves for what would be
intended as cheap labor is what led to its popularity in North America.
“‘Am Not I A Man and a Brother’ dates to around 1800 and features a
dominant motif detailing the agonizing and insufferable treatment of
slaves on a Caribbean sugar plantation during the Transatlantic Slave
Trade.
Based on a design commissioned by the Committee for the Abolition of
the Slave Trade on 5 July 1787, the painting is considered to be one of
the first instances of a logo designed for a political cause. It was
famously used by the potter Josiah Wedgwood for his persuasive antislavery ceramic medallions and went on to become the dominant image
of abolition campaigning in the 18th and 19th centuries.” (Galway, 2018)

Caste system
The Indian caste system is primarily a division of human endeavor, yet the
caste system also profoundly impacts Hinduism.
A four-tiered system, the main castes of birth into the Hindu social system
include: Brahmin (priestly class), Kshatriya (administrative class), Vaishya
(mercantile class), Shudra (worker class), and Dalit (untouchables).
Karma determines birth into one of the main castes, which means all of
humanity is created unequal. Dalits are India’s “hidden apartheid” and
constitute approximately 20 percent (three hundred million) of India’s
population. The exploitation and oppression of the Dalits causes this
population to occupy a position of perpetual economic and physical
vulnerability, and condemnation of the Dalits varies from social ostracism to
punitive violence.
According to Hinduism, people strive to achieve release from samsara, the
cyclical process of death and rebirth, and consequently, the notion of karma,
which is the law of cause and effect.
The caste system associated with Hinduism is not only the world’s oldest
social hierarchy; it is also an example of a traditional economy. According to
the Hindu caste system, one should not attempt to alter one’s destiny, but to
commit life to one’s current degree or estate in a way that is similar to the
European feudal system. As an economic structure, the caste system is
oppressive in restricting any opportunity to change one’s occupational or
social status.
Colonialism
Colonialism is a particular relationship of domination between states,
involving a wide range of interrelated strategies, including territorial
occupation, population settlement, and extraction of economic resources by
the colonizing state.
Historically, colonialism also depended upon legal, cultural, and political
justifications of the colonial project in the metropole and the colonized
state. While colonialism and imperialism share many of these
characteristics, colonialism involved significant amounts of settlement of
citizens from the colonial center in the colonized territory, as well as formal
relationships of law and governance between colonial states and their
subjects.
The term colony has a long history and has been applied to a wide range of
state arrangements, beginning with the extension of the legal status of
Roman citizens to the conquered territories they settled. It was later applied
in the sixteenth century to refer to the conquest by competing European
powers — initially Portugal and Spain, and in the seventeenth to nineteenth
centuries the Dutch, French, English, and Germans — of territories in Africa,
the Americas, India, and Asia.
The era of formal colonialism is widely understood to have ended by the
mid-twentieth century with waves of decolonization leading to independent
nation states. However, the term has more recently been used to refer to
informal relations of domination and economic exploitation by former
colonial powers of previous colonies, and to the assertion of economic,
military, and cultural dominance by ascendant global powers, the United
States paramount among these.
Anti-Semitism
Semites are both Jews and Arabs who emerged from a common ancestral
and geographical setting in the Middle East. However, anti-Semitism refers
specifically to prejudice against Jews as a religious, ethnic, or racial body. It
can include a wide range of attitudes and expressions, from individual
hostility to legal discrimination and violence against Jews as a group. Like so
many stereotypes, anti-Semitism is based on a myth—one with the power
to influence individual attitudes toward Jews and their place in society and,
collectively, to impact the larger culture. It has no basis in fact or reason, but
its acolytes make vague references to historical or pseudoscientific genetic
arguments in support of their prejudices.
Accusations against Jews of two millennia ago, or toward some individual
Jew today, are portrayed as the collective responsibility of all Jews as a
people, who must be punished by strong measures, up to and including
genocide.
Religious anti-Semitism attacks Jews as being responsible for the death of
Jesus, and for practicing their minority faith, which is portrayed as the devil’s
product. It promises a cessation of persecution if Jews give up their faith and
assimilate into an approved religion.
Racial anti-Semitism identifies Jews as a genetically distinct race. They are
an innately subhuman race that can never assimilate with the superior
culture but conspire to pollute the more advanced Aryan race and control
the world, its government, and its economy. They must be stopped at all
costs.
Holocaust
Nürnberg Laws, two race-based measures depriving Jews of rights,
designed by Adolf Hitler and approved by the Nazi Party at a convention
in Nürnberg on September 15, 1935.
One, the Reichsbürgergesetz (German: “Law of the Reich Citizen”),
deprived Jews of German citizenship, designating them “subjects of the
state.”
The other, the Gesetz zum Schutze des Deutschen Blutes und der
Deutschen Ehre (“Law for the Protection of German Blood and German
Honour”), usually called simply the Blutschutzgesetz (“Blood Protection
Law”), forbade marriage or sexual relations between Jews and “citizens
of German or kindred blood” in order to prohibit marriage and
consequently to prohibit reproduction of the 'inferior race’.
These measures were among the first of the racist Nazi laws that
culminated in the Holocaust.
The capitalized term Holocaust emerged in the 1950s and, over the
next two decades, gradually replaced the German term Endlösung (final
solution) for the macrokilling project of European Jews by Nazi Germany.
Some authors have used the expression holocaust in reference to other
mass-killing events, such as genocidal policies against Native Americans
in the United States (nineteenth century), Tutsis in Rwanda (1994), and
Muslims in Bosnia (1992–1995).
The Nuremberg
Laws
Genocide
The term genocide was originally used for Nazi patterns of state violence
against the European Jewish populations during World War II (1939–1945).
The word combines the Greek prefix for race or tribe (geno-) with the Latin
suffix for killing/murder (-cide). The most frequently cited examples of
genocide include the Holocaust during World War II, the “killing fields” of
Cambodia in the 1970s, the “100 days” in Rwanda in 1994, and the
Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia and Herzegovina in July 1995.
In 1948, Raphael Lemkin’s concept of genocide was codified and
established as an international crime through the United Nations
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.
The convention defined the term as “acts committed with intent to destroy,
in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such.” It
is important to note that the convention’s definition does not include the
targeting of political, ideological, economic, professional, or other groups.
As defined by the convention, overt acts of genocide include
(1) Killing members of the group,
(2) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group,
(3) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring
about its physical destruction in whole or in part,
(4) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group, and
(5) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group
Ethnic
cleansing
Ethnic cleansing is the intentional act of removing by force
or threat of force any national, ethnic, religious, racial, or
socioeconomically homogeneous group from a specified
area of land, usually within the borders of a sovereign state,
up to and including genocide.
Although ethnic cleansing may encompass genocide, the
term does not mean that the target group is specifically
designated for total extermination; rather, the group is
targeted for removal from a specific geographical location or
expulsion from a population. The target group may be
subjected to rape, murder, arson, and torture, among other
acts of violence.
Some examples of ethnic cleansing are the Americans’
treatment of Native Americans in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries, the Turkish genocide of Armenians in
1915, the Nazi Holocaust of Jews and Gypsies during World
War II (1939–1945), the Balkans conflicts of the 1990s
(Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia, and Kosovo), the conflict in the
Darfur region of Sudan, and the Rohingya mass exodus on
Aug. 25, 2017.

Apartheid
Apartheid is an Afrikaans word meaning “separateness.” It
was the official government policy in South Africa from 1948
until a negotiated transition that culminated in the first
democratic elections in 1994, with Nelson Mandela winning.
In 1976, the UN General Assembly recognized apartheid as
a crime against humanity.
Though the majority of its inhabitants were Black, they
were dominated by a white minority that controlled the
land, the wealth, and the government—a discriminatory
social structure that would later be codified in the country’s
legal system and called apartheid.
Over the next 95 years, Mandela would help topple South
Africa’s brutal social order. During a lifetime of resistance,
imprisonment, and leadership, Nelson Mandela led South
Africa out of apartheid and into an era of reconciliation and
majority rule.
Dhimmi
Literally meaning “protected person,” dhimmi is the term
applied in early Islam to Christians, Jews, and others; and
refers to specific individuals living in Muslim lands, who
were granted special status and safety in Islamic law in
return for paying the capital tax.
This status was originally only made available to non- Muslims who were People of the Book ‘ahl alkitab’, namely,
Jews and Christians), but was later extended to include
Zoroastrians, Mandeans, and, in some areas, Hindus and
Buddhists.
The term connotes an obligation of the state to protect the
individual, including the individual's life, property, and
freedom of religion and worship, and required loyalty to the
empire, and a poll tax known as the jizya.
Dhimmi had fewer legal and social rights than Muslims, but
more rights than other non-Muslim religious subjects.
This status applied to millions of people living from the
Atlantic Ocean to India from the seventh century until
modern times.
Collectivisation
Collectivization, a policy pursued in the Soviet
Union and most other communist countries, refers
to a process whereby private agricultural lands
were seized by the state and transferred either to
collective farms (kolkhoz in Russian) or state farms
(sovkhoz). The policy was unpopular with farmers
and was accompanied by violence. It also
contributed to lower agricultural output.
Nonetheless, politically it helped consolidate
communist authority in the countryside.
Collectivization became a key feature of the Soviet
communist model and was pursued in many
communist states, including most of Eastern Europe
(except Yugoslavia and Poland), China, Vietnam,
and Cambodia. As in the Soviet case, it was often
resisted by farmers and was accompanied by
violence.
Stalin’s Collectivisation of Agriculture
Hegemony
The term hegemony means domination with consent.
From the Greek hegemonia, it denotes leadership of an
alliance by a single leader, or hegemon. Although ancient
hegemons tended to possess great power, their allies
conceded them leading roles due to other qualities, such as
skill and virtue, as well as the policies they embraced.
The tendency toward domination without consent,
however, has led many international relations scholars to
equate hegemony with domination that does not respect the
independent existence and autonomy of allies, thus providing
a different definition of the term.
Rather than using force or explicit coercion, hegemonic
power rested on the successful manipulation of cultural and
social institutions -- such as the media -- to shape the limits
of economic and political opportunities for citizens.
This gave the dominant group in society a position to
influence the preferences of others in favour of the existing
order; and to ensure that representatives of these dominant
interests served in key monetary, regulatory, judicial and
bureaucratic posts.
Discrimination
Discrimination, in its modern usage, means treating someone unfairly or
unfavorably and denying individuals or groups of people equality of treatment.
International labor organizations; the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization; and various United Nations (UN) treaties define
discrimination as any distinction, exclusion, or restriction of preference based on
race, color, descent, disability, age, sexual orientation or national or ethnic origin
that has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment,
or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the
political, economic, social, cultural, or any other field of public life.
Four forms of discrimination include inequality in treatment, imposing disabilities,
granting privileges, and imposing obligations. Discrimination as denial of equality
has many faces, including denial of economic or social opportunities, power, status,
access to education, and career opportunities.
Girls and women suffer most of the negative impact of rigid gender norms and
roles - they are more likely to experience restrictions of their freedom and mobility,
they experience epidemic levels of violence and harassment across the globe and
have fewer opportunities to choose how to live their lives.
Boys and men suffer too. Ideas about what it means to be a man force boys and
men to behave in very limited ways which can harm them. Negative masculinities
encouraged in boys serve to perpetuate the cycle of discrimination and inequality.
Gender discriminations include: Restricted sexual and reproductive rights; Sexual
harassment, catcalling; Gender stereotypes at school and work; Objectification and
poor representation; and others.
Homophobia
Homophobia refers to aversion, bias, or discriminatory actions, attitudes, or beliefs directed
toward individuals who either have or are perceived as having nonheterosexual identities
such as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer people (GLBTQ).
The term came into its contemporary usage in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when it was
used to describe what Kenneth Smith called “a fear of homosexuals” and the anxiety that
one may be perceived by others as homosexual.
Homophobic fear and anxiety are seen to be negative attributes, and in this regard, the
term links to other social prejudices such as sexism, racism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia, and
classism.
In this regard, GLBTQ+ groups have used the term to organize against discriminatory public
policies and cultural attitudes.
The term internalized homophobia relates to anxiety about or aversion to one’s own
homosexuality or nonnormative sexuality. Internalized homophobia has been linked to low
self-esteem and suicide in GLBTQ+ individuals.
Examples of homophobia include name-calling, harassment, social exclusion, job and
housing discrimination, criminalization of homosexual sexual practices, and violence.
Closely related terms to homophobia are heteronormativity and heterosexism.
Heteronormativity refers to the assumption that heterosexuality is and should be the norm.
Heterosexism (also sometimes called compulsory heterosexuality) refers to the array of
attitudes, actions, and institutions that structure heterosexuality as the norm.
 The institution of marriage, to the extent that it privileges and attaches benefits to certain
kinds of relationships such as marriage between opposite-sex couples, is a heterosexist one.
Next, prohibiting gays and lesbians from marrying each other could be considered
homophobic. Finally, the assumption that opposite-sex marriage is “natural,” along with the
pervasiveness of opposite-sex-only marriage within society, are reflections of its
heteronormativity
Cult of
Personality
Cult of personality refers to the common practice
among twentieth-century dictatorships of promoting
religious types of devotion to their national leader.
As described in George Orwell’s novel 1984, through skillful use of the
mass media and pervasive secret police monitoring, a modern state can
create fanatical mass adulation of its leader on a scale not possible in
premodern dictatorships.
In the absence of democratic elections, this provides a
mechanism to secure the loyalty of a state’s subjects.
The term itself originated with the February 1956
speech by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in which he
denounced Joseph Stalin’s “cult of personality.” Some
post-Soviet leaders did generate a so-called cult of
personality.
One open question is to what extent personality cults
are the result of pressure from below, from local
officials and ordinary citizens, rather than being simply
constructed from above by the national leadership
Hate speech
Though hate speech comes in many forms, liberal democracies
in the earlier twentieth century concerned themselves primarily
with speech that vilified or criticized individuals and groups based
on the categories of race, nationality, and religion.
In the 1920s, the term race hate was the preferred label for such
expression, while group libel emerged as the predominant
designation in the 1940s and 1950s. By the 1980s and 1990s,
gender and sexual orientation were among items added to the list
of categories considered hate speech.
Human Rights Watch provides a typical contemporary definition
of hate speech as “any form of expression regarded as offensive
to racial, ethnic and religious groups and other discrete
minorities, and to women.”
Hate speech and its regulation pose a dilemma for liberal
democracies. On the one hand, hate speech threatens social
order and the security (or sense of security) of targeted
individuals and groups. On the other hand, prohibiting hate
speech can threaten freedom of speech, especially if such
expression is defined too broadly and the causative link between
expression and harm is not direct.
Xenophobia
Xenophobia has come to be defined as the fear of foreigners.
Etymologically, xenophobia can be broken down into the Greek
terms xenos (stranger) and phobos (fear).
In common usage xenophobia refers to a disdain for individuals
or groups of persons that are different from oneself. This dislike
can range from simple rude comments to much more dangerous
forms of intolerance. Therefore, the term can have varying levels
of severity in the amount of the fear of the foreign population, as
well as in how this fear is manifested in thought and action
The future of xenophobia as a human condition is unlikely to
end. This, of course, is a sad report on human relations that
people fear what is not directly familiar to themselves and their
normal experiences.
One can only hope that the future will provide increased
opportunities for diverse groups and populations to share their
cultural traditions in an atmosphere of genuine interest in the
other and mutual respect for them and their ways of life.
(Prilleltensky & Gonick, 1996)
Overcoming oppression
Detailed political and psychological factors shaping conditions of oppression are needed in order to apply the
knowledge to eliminate unjust social policies and practices.
This state of increased social awareness develops in stages. Watts and Abdul-Adil (in press) suggest that there is a
sequential order to the evolution of critical consciousness:
1. Acritical stage: At this phase people are unaware of power inequalities and their impact on their lives. The belief in a
just world prevails. Oppressed individuals accept the legitimizing myths of personal blame and natural causes.
2. Adaptive stage: There is an acknowledgment of power differentials, but the social structure is perceived to be
immutable. People try to adapt and benefit from whatever rewards the system can offer.
3. Pre-critical stage: There is an emerging understanding of asymmetric power relations and their adverse effects on the
lives of the oppressed. During this stage people question the need to adapt to the system.
4. Critical stage: There is a deeper realization of the sources of oppression, accompanied by the impulse to work toward
social change and a more equitable distribution of resources in society.
5. Liberation stage: The experience of oppression becomes obvious. The newly acquired awareness of the sources of
disempowerment is followed by involvement in social and political action to eradicate personal and social injustice

Political
behavior
Diana Toimbek. Associate Professor, PhD Week 7
We know that science is based on empiricism, that science does not accept as correct what is not observable,
and that science rejects what has been falsified. Such is the very logic of science itself. However, a number of
problems may complicate this logic. Specifically,
HOW CAN WE HAVE A SCIENCE OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR WHEN HUMAN BEHAVIOR IS OFTEN UNIQUE?
Empirically based science of politics is limited by the essence ( nonrepeatability, or low levels of repeatability) of
the subject matter (human behavior) under observation.
Social scientists and philosophers have often pointed to this problem
Can science offer better predictions than provided by hunches, reading the stars, interpreting Tarot cards, or
consulting fortune tellers?
Thus, no matter how hard we try to be scientific, we may be viewing the world in a biased manner. As a
consequence, falsification is a complex matter.
We may be victims of the of our own idols, viewing the world in terms of misconceptions, prejudices, and
stereotypes; the means of falsification may exist, but they may be outside our field of vision and imagination.
(Grigsby, 2009).Introduction
Political behavior is the study of the way people think, feel, and act with regard to politics.
It includes public opinion, ideology, partisanship, political knowledge, participation, campaigns, the media, and
polarization (process of politicization).
In this lecture we will discuss topics in the context of broader questions about political behavior, including:
Political culture
Public opinion and mass belief systems
Political participation
Political communication
Civil society and interest groups
(Hague & Harrop, 2015).
What is political behavior?
Political culture
Political culture is essential to an understanding of government and politics in its many
varieties.
Culture is the central human characteristic, expressing our essence as aware social beings.
Unlike nature (with which it is often contrasted), culture involves values, symbols, meanings,
and expectations. It tells us who we are, what is important to us, and how we should behave.
The concept of political culture flows from this broader account of culture. It describes the
overall pattern in society of beliefs, attitudes and values towards the political system.
The concept of political culture is attractive, but can be misused: cultures do not always
coincide with states, and we should avoid the pitfalls of stereotypes about 'national cultures’
(Hague & Harrop, 2015).
We should know that…
Almost every country – except perhaps the very smallest - will contain multiple culturally distinctive
social groups. The result may be either a national political culture with one or more subcultures, or
a multicultural society.
We should remember that cultures do not always coincide exactly with countries; most religions,
ethnic groups, and civilizations span national borders.
We must acknowledge that political culture can change over time; it is far from a static concept
and can both influence and be influenced by broader changes in the way societies approach
government and politics.
There is a danger of invoicing cultural factors when we can think of nothing else: 'it's just part of
their culture’
Above all, we should always beware of reducing political culture to a stereotyped 'national
character’.
(Hague & Harrop, 2015).
Elite political culture
Political culture is a concept applicable not only to the mass population, but also to political
elites. Even where mass attitudes to politics are well developed, it is still the views of the elite
which exert the most direct effect on political decisions.
Because the values of elites are more explicit, systematic and consequential than are those
of the population at large (Verba, 1987).
In a liberal democracy, parties offer contrasting and competing values and policies. But
underlying these contrasts, we often find tacit agreements and shared understandings,
creating an elite culture that can be more than a representative fragment of the values of the
wider society.
Many authoritarian regimes are sustained by a cultural emphasis among their populations on
security.
(Hague & Harrop, 2015).
Public opinion
Public opinion is the study of political attitudes in the aggregate, focused on measuring how the
public feels about policy issues.
It focuses to understand following aspects : direction, stability, intensity, and salience.
•Direction refers to the extent to which the public supports or opposes a given policy issue
•Stability focuses on the extent to which public opinion remains stable over time
•Intensity is an indicator of how strong people’s attitudes are, or how important the issue is to them
•Salience refers to the extent to which the issue is at the forefront of political discussion and debate
Haas & Schneider, 2017
Nature of mass belief system
Mass belief system is closely connected to the ideology. A great majority of people neither adhere to a full,
complete set of beliefs which produces a clear ideology nor do they have a clear grasp of what ideology is.
However, the level of political sophistication is positively correlated with people’s level of education, degree of
political involvement, and amount of political information (Apter, 1964).
The role of core beliefs and values are central elements of mass belief systems.
Citizens must have a sufficient knowledge of the workings of the political system if they intend to influence
and control the actions of their representatives.
Almond and Verba (1963), for example, considered cognition important in defining a political culture, and Dahl
(1989, 307–8) stressed the quality of the political debate as a precondition to arrive at what he has called
“enlightened understanding.”
Public’s political sophistication fell short of the theoretical ideal even in the established democracies. Because
majority of people bring very little understanding to their political participation.
Goodin, 2013
Political participation
In general, it is involvement in collective decision-making
The quality of governance depends - in large part – on the extent to which citizens participate (or are allowed to participate) in the process of governing.
The quantity and the quality of participation vary not only between regime types but also within individual countries over time and between its social
groups. Even in democracies, political participation is far from equal.
Large numbers of people are either poorly informed about the issues at stake, or choose not to express themselves. And in authoritarian systems, of
course, their views and opinions are not usually entertained to begin with.
Participation is intimately tied to levels of public knowledge about government and politics, with one driving the other. Some authors suggest that public
opinion has become the central mechanism of representation in liberal democracy
Many of those who fail to participate do so because they feel marginalized or alienated, or think that their involvement will make no difference, or see
government as a set of institutions dominated by elites.
Humans may not be political animals, but they routinely make cost-benefit calculations, and some make the rational calculation that participating is not
worth the time or the trouble. Or, they believe that the only way to make themselves heard is through extremism and violence.
While female participation has increased substantially, especially in democracies. gender inequalities in political participation still huge due to social
pressure, glass ceiling and/or gender prejudices
(Hague & Harrop, 2015).
Political participation in
authoritarian states
The argument is sometimes made that political participation, at least as understood in liberal democracies, is
an empty concept in non-democratic settings. After all, the nature of authoritarian regimes is that they must
seek to control popular activity in order to ensure their own survival and retention of power.
Yet the evidence suggests that there is substantial political participation in many countries beyond the liberal
democratic world, even if its character is often distinctive.
Participation typically operates through informal sectors such as social groups, art, music, literature, rather
than formal channels such as political parties.
In authoritarian regimes, the limits and nature of participation are often subject to an implicit dialogue as
activists test the boundaries of the acceptable.
In many developing countries where most people are focused on daily survival, and both education and
communication are limited, there may be no such thing as political participation on anything beyond local
matters.
(Hague & Harrop, 2015).
Political communication
Political communication: ·n1e means by which political information is produced and disseminated,
and the effect of this information flow on the political process.
Mass communication lies at the heart of political discourse – FOURTH ESTATE. It informs
governments and citizens, it defines the limits of expression (fewer in democracies than in
authoritarian states), and it provides us with 'mental maps' of the political world outside our direct
experience.
Too often, mass media coverage is assumed to be influential without there being any evidence
cited in support (always factcheck!).
The technology of mass political communication has changed dramatically over the past century,
taking us from a time when newspapers dominated to the era of broadcasting (first radio and then
television), and bringing us to the age of the internet, with instant information in unparalleled
quantities from numerous sources.
(Hague & Harrop, 2015).
Political communication in
authoritarian states
A free flow of communication provides one test for distinguishing between liberal democracies and authoritarian
regimes.
In authoritarian regimes, leaders have varied and often subtle means for limiting independent journalism through
financial harassment (taxes), laws that forbid to insult governmental bodies, compulsory registration that are
constantly being refused.
Far from acting as the fourth estate, casting a searchlight into the darker corners of government, journalists in
authoritarian states defer to political authority.
The justification for these restrictions is typically an overriding national requirement for social stability, nation-building,
stability & security, and economic development. The sub-text is that we cannot afford Western freedoms until we have
caught up, and perhaps not even then.
In Central Asian countries large parts of the media remain in state hands, giving the authorities direct leverage.
The state also typically retains ownership of leading television channels.
(Hague & Harrop, 2015).
Civil society: essential mean of
development
According to the World Bank: “Civil society ... refers to a wide array of organizations: community groups, nongovernmental organizations [NGOs], labour unions, indigenous groups, charitable organizations, faith-based
organizations, professional associations, and foundations.”
(Ingram, 2020)
Civil society comprises organizations that are not associated with government.
Civil society organizations play multiple roles:
They are an important source of information for both citizens and government. They
monitor government policies and actions and hold government accountable.
They engage in advocacy and offer alternative policies for government, the private
sector, and other institutions.
They deliver services, especially to the poor and underserved.
They defend citizen rights and work to change and uphold social norms and behaviors
Interest groups
Where most institutions of government are formally outlined in the constitution, interest groups are
founded and operate largely outside these formal structures. Their goal - - is to influence policy
without becoming part of government. They come in several types:
Protective groups work in the material interests of their members,
Promotional groups advocate ideas and policies of a more general nature,
Think-tanks work to shape the policy debate through research.
A vibrant interest group community is generally a sign of a healthy civil society but it can also
become a barrier to the implementation of the popular will as expressed in elections.
Interest groups - also known as “pressure groups” - use a combination oi direct and indirect
channels of influence and are a crucial channel of communication between society and
government.
(Hague & Harrop, 2015).
Interest groups in authoritarian states
In authoritarian countries, the relationship between government
and interest groups is very different from the democratic model
In liberal democracies, powerful groups can capture elements of
government but in authoritarian states those groups that do exist
are generally subordinate to the regime.
Authoritarian rulers see freely organized groups as a potential
threat to their own power; hence, they seek either to repress such
groups, or incorporate them within their power structure – the
groups are prisoner rather than master.

Basics of Public Policy
Diana Toimbek
Associate Professor, PhD
Week 8
Why do we need to know it?
 In the course of their daily lives people are affected, directly and indirectly, obviously and subtly, by an extensive array of
public policies.
 Public policies in a modern, complex society are indeed ubiquitous. They confer advantages and disadvantages, cause
pleasure, irritation, and pain, and collectively have important consequences for our well-being and happiness. They
constitute a significant portion of our environment. This being so, we should know something about public policies,
including how they are formed, budgeted, implemented, and evaluated. There are also scientific, professional, and political
reasons for studying public policies and policymaking.
 Politically, many people want to engage in policy advocacy, using knowledge of public policy to formulate and promote
"good" public policies that will have the "right" goals, that is, goals which serve their purposes. They may think of themselves
as liberals, conservatives, libertarians, communitarians, or socialists and disagree greatly in their notions of what is good or
just. The research efforts of policy advocates are frequently skewed by their wish to generate data and analysis in line with
their preferences. In contrast, policy study is motivated by the intent to be impartial.
 Policymaking process is viewed as an inherently political process involving conflict and struggle among people (public
officials and private citizens) with conflicting interests, values, and desires on policy issues. Therefore it is crucial to
understand the process, approaches and methodology of “good” policymaking
(Anderson, 2003)
The public and its policies
Ruling is an assertion of the will, an attempt to exercise control, to shape the world. Public policies are instruments of this
assertive ambition.
All our talk of ‘‘making’’ public policy, of ‘‘choosing’’ and ‘‘deciding,’’ is all about that politics and policy making is mostly a
matter of persuasion.
Decide, choose, legislate as they will, policy makers must carry people with them, if their determinations are to have the full
force of policy. That is most commonly demonstrated in systems that attempt to practice liberal democracy; but a wealth of
evidence shows that even in the most coercive systems of social organization there are powerful limits to the straightforward
power of command (Etzioni 1965).
Policy is not only about arguing, but is also about bargaining. Governing is less and less a matter of ruling through hierarchical
authority structures, and more and more a matter of negotiating through a decentralized series of floating alliances.
Broad cooperation from a great many effectively independent actors is required in order for any of them to accomplish their
goals. This is when a political participation of interest groups comes into place forming the “networked governance”.
(Moran, et al, 2008)
These closely interact, often overlap, and in part cannot be separated even analytically.
The absence of different terms for ‘‘politics’’ and ‘‘policy’’ in most languages other than
English reflects the difficulties of that distinction.
Grand policies are value based, goal directed, and goal seeking. If the values are
superficial and slogan-like and the goals are misperceived then choices will be counterproductive. Hence the importance of improving value clarification and goal setting.
However, value judgement is a subjective process entrusted by the basic norms of
democracy to elected politicians, subject to legal review and sometimes public override.
However, political feasibility must not be neglected. Modern democratic politics often
pushes rulers in the direction of subordinating policy to politics and marketing, with rulers
often giving priority to ‘‘blowing of bubbles’’ over weaving the future. But grand-policy
quality depends on the ability of rulers to differentiate between policy and politics and
giving priority to policy requirements before making unavoidable compromises with
political reality. Training should clarify and emphasize this distinction.
Separating politics and policy
(Moran, et al, 2008)
(Hague & Harrop, 2015).
 Studying public policy offers a distinctive perspective within the study of politics. It involves looking at what
governments do, rather than the institutional framework within which they do it.
 Underlying much policy analysis is a concern with the quality and effectiveness of what government does.
Policy analysis asks 'How well?', rather than just 'How?' or ‘’Why?'
 There is always a danger of imagining policymaking as a rational process with precise goals. The incremental
and garbage-can models offer a hearty dose of realism. Policy, it is always worth remembering, is embedded
in politics; a statement of policy can be a cover for inaction.
 Breaking the policy process into its component stages, from initiation to evaluation, helps in analyzing and
comparing policies. The later stages, implementation and evaluation, provide a different focus which is
integral to policy analysis.
 Policy diffusion and convergence studies help explain how policies evolve in similar directions in multiple
countries.
 Policy in authoritarian regimes plays a secondary role to politics. where the overriding requirement for survival
in office often leads to corruption, uncertainty, and stagnation.
Key arguments
Public Policy: an Overview
 Public policy is a collective term for the objectives and actions of government. It is more than a decision or even a set of
decisions, but instead describes the approaches that elected officials adopt in dealing with the demands of their office, and
the actions they take (or avoid taking) to address public problems and needs.
 The choices they make are driven by a variety of influences, including the priorities they face, their political ideology. the
economic and political climate, and the budgets they have available. .
 Policies consist both of aims and of means.
 When parties or candidates run for office, they will have a shopping list of issues they wish to address, and the positions
they take will be their policies. When they are elected or appointed to office, they will usually continue to pursue these
policies, which will be expressed in the form of public statements, government programmes, laws, and actions.
 Whatever the course taken and the eventual outcome, the actions of government (combined with their inaction) are
understood as their policies
 These policies become the defining qualities of governments and their leaders, and the records of these policies in
addressing and alleviating problems will become the reference points by which governments and leaders are assessed.
(Hague & Harrop, 2015).

•The tendency for policy programmes to spread across countries
Policy convergence
•The tendency for policies in different countries to become more alike
(Hague & Harrop, 2015). Mechanisms of
policy convergence
Effect Example
Independent
problem-solving
As countries develop, similar problems emerge,
often resulting in similar policies
Under-regulated industrialization leads to air and water
pollution
International
agreement
National policies converge as countries seek to
comply with international laws, regulations, and
standards
Membership of the WTO imposes common rules on
member states
International
competition
Policies providing an economic or political
advantage will be replaced elsewhere
Privatization of state-owned enterprises has spread
throughout the developed world, with NZ and the UK
among the innovators
Policy learning Explicit lesson-drawing can occur even when no
competitive advantage ensues
Capital punishment is abolished because evidence from
other countries indicates a limited impact on crime rates
Coercion and
conditionality
One country makes policy requirements of
another, for example in return for aid
Reforms imposed on Greece initially in 2010, in return for
financial help in responding to the debt crisis
 Policymaking cannot adequately be studied apart from the environment or context in which it
occurs. According to systems theory, demands for policy actions stem from problems and conflicts
in the environment and are transmitted to the political system by groups, officials, and others. At
the same time, the environment both limits and directs what policy-makers can effectively do.
 The environment, broadly viewed, includes geographic characteristics; ; demographic variables
such as population size, age distribution, racial composition, and spatial location; political culture;
social structure, or the class system; and the economic system.
 Socio-economic conditions of a country are determining aspect of policy courses. Public policies
often arise out of conflicts among groups of people, private and official, with differing interests
and desires. One of the prime sources of conflict, particularly in modern industrial societies, is
economic activity. Conflicts may develop between the interests of big business and small
business, employers and employees, wholesalers and retailers, bankers and securities dealers,
hospitals and medical-insurance companies, farmers and agricultural-commodity importers,
consumers and manufacturers, privileged and underprivileged groups, and so on.

(Hague & Harrop, 2015).
Levels of politics in policymaking
Micropolitics
•micropolitical decisions appear to be distributive and can be made without considering limited resources. That
is, such decisions appear to affect only those immediately interested and are usually made on the basis of
mutual noninterference
Subsystem politics
•Through time the various connections may intensify or fade among the policy intermediaries and the executive
and congressional bureaucracies. There is no need to assume that only one kind of subsystem can exist at a
time. Rather subsystems take various forms that can be arrayed along a continuum
Macropolitics
•Some policy issues attract enough attention or become sufficiently controversial to be ripe for action in the
macropolitical areas. Some issues are "born" to be macropolitical, because of their consequences for large
numbers of people and the controversy enveloping them they attracted wide interest and participation from rank
and file citizens and political elites alike
(Hague & Harrop, 2015).
it is now conventional wisdom that if policy study does not consider the characteristics
and dimensions of the problems that stimulate government action, it is less than
complete.
It is important to know both why some problems are acted on and others are neglected
and why a problem is defined in one way rather than another. This helps one determine
where power lies in the political system. Moreover, whether a problem is foreign or
domestic, a new item or the outgrowth of an existing policy, or specific or broad in scope
helps to determine the nature of the ensuing policymaking process.
Evaluating a policy also requires information on the substance and dimensions of the
target problem in order to appraise the policy's effectiveness.
A policy problem can be defined as a condition or situation that produces needs or
dissatisfaction among people and for which relief or redress by governmental action is
sought.
Policy formation: Problems
(Hague & Harrop, 2015).
Policy formation: Agenda setting
 Of the thousands and thousands of demands made upon government, only a small number will receive
serious consideration by public policy-makers. In other words, each problem must compete for official
attention because legislators and executives have limited time and resources.
 Decisions to consider some problems mean that others will not be taken up, at least for the time being. The
demands that policy-makers choose to or feel compelled to act on at a given time, or at least appear to be
acting on, constitute the policy agenda
 To achieve agenda status, a public problem must be converted into an issue, or a matter requiring
governmental attention
(Hague & Harrop, 2015).
 Policy formulation involves developing pertinent and acceptable proposed courses of action (often called
alternatives, proposals, or options) for dealing with public problems.
 Policy formulation does not always culminate in a law, executive order, or administrative rule. Policy-makers
may decide not to take positive action on a problem, but instead to leave it alone, to let matters work
themselves out. Or they may be unable to agree on what to do.
 Who is involved in formulating policy proposals:
• Government
• Governmental agencies
• Legislators and executive branches
• Organizations
• Interest groups
 Policy formulation involves two markedly different sorts of activities. One is to decide generally what, if
anything, should be done about a problem. Second, legislation or administrative rules must be drafted that,
when adopted, will appropriately carry the agreed-upon principles or statements into effect.
Policy formation: Formulation
(Hague & Harrop, 2015).
“
• Problem identification, agenda setting, and policy formulation
constitute the pre-decision segment of the policy process in that they
do not involve formal decisions on what will become public policy.
They are important, however, because they help determine which
issues will be considered, which will be given further examination,
and which will be abandoned. Thus they involve political conflict and
help set the terms for additional conflict.
(Hague & Harrop, 2015).
 What is typically involved at the policy-adoption stage is not selection from among a number of full-blown
policy alternatives but rather action on a preferred policy alternative for which the proponents of action think
they can win approval, even though it does not provide all they might like. As the formulation process moves
toward the decision stage, some provisions will be rejected, others accepted, and still others modified;
differences will be narrowed; bargains will be struck; until ultimately, in some instances, the final policy
decision will be only a formality.
 Although private individuals and organizations also participate in making policy decisions, the formal authority
to decide rests with public officials: legislators, executives, administrators, judges. Through the adoption
process policies acquire the "weight of public authority.“
 Policy adoption decision criteria:
• Values (organizational, professional, personal, policy, and ideological),
• Political-party affiliation (party loyalty),
• Constituency interests
• Public opinion,
• Decision rules (guidelines)
• Public interests
Policy adoption
(Hague & Harrop, 2015).
Presidential Decision-making
 Apart from an integral role in the legislative process, the president can also be viewed as a policy adopter in
his own right. In foreign affairs, much policy is a product of presidential actions and decisions, based either on
the president’s constitutional authority or broad delegations of power.
 By considering some of the factors that shape and limit presidential decision-making, we not only can gain
useful insight into presidential decision-making but also discover another perspective from which to view
decision-making in general.
 Several factors help shape and limit presidential decision-making. One is permissibility, an aspect of which is
legality. The president is expected to act in conformity with the Constitution, statutes, and court decisions. The
lack of a clear constitutional or legal basis certainly contributes to wide criticism and can be seen as a sign of
limited democratic society.
 A second factor is available resources. The president does not have the resources to do everything she/he
might want to do, whether by resources one means money, manpower, patronage, time, or credibility.
 A third factor is available time, in the sense of timing and the need to act.
(Hague & Harrop, 2015).
 It is a rare public policy that can be carried into effect without the expenditure of money. At a
minimum, funding will be needed for administrative personnel, office space, and equipment.
 The budget conveys a good overview of the government's total set of policies for the fiscal
year it covers.
 The budget is not simply a financial statement; it is also a statement of policy. Conflicts over
money are in reality conflicts over policies.
 Hence, one of the biggest hindrances of quality policy implementation is money laundering.
 Corruption is an old social phenomenon intrinsic to governments, individuals, organizations,
and countries, both developed and developing. Despite sustained efforts of many states and
international organizations to curb it, corruption as an ethical and legal problem still exists.
Budgeting and Public Policy
(Hague & Harrop, 2015).
“
Corruption is a product of self-aggrandizement; of unrealistically low
remuneration which makes it impossible for public servants to live within
their legitimate means; and of a closed political system which inevitably
tends to exclude aggregated interests'. Corruption leads to loss of much
needed revenue and human talent for development, distorts priorities for
public policy, and shifts scarce resources away from the public interest.
The mutual distrust that results among the different sections of society,
and the growth of despondency in the general public, are incompatible with
the requirements for successful public policy.
(Ouma, 1991)
“
Corruption is a complex social, political and economic phenomenon that affects all
countries. Corruption undermines democratic institutions, slows economic development
and contributes to governmental instability. Corruption attacks the foundation of
democratic institutions by distorting electoral processes, perverting the rule of law and
creating bureaucratic quagmires whose only reason for existing is the soliciting of bribes.
Economic development is stunted because foreign direct investment is discouraged and
small businesses within the country often find it impossible to overcome the "start-up
costs" required because of corruption.
Corruption can include giving or accepting bribes or inappropriate gifts, double-dealing,
under-the-table transactions, manipulating elections, diverting funds, laundering money,
and defrauding investors.

 The most useful form of policy evaluation for policy-makers and administrators, and for policy critics
who want a factual basis for their positions, is a systematic evaluation that tries to determine causeand-effect relationships and rigorously measures the results of policy. It is of course often impossible
to measure quantitatively the effect of public policies, especially social policies, with any real precision.
In this context, then, to "measure rigorously" is to seek to assess policy impacts as carefully and
objectively as possible, using the best information available and making careful judgments. There is no
reason to assume that "if it cannot be counted, it does not count.“
 A variety of conditions raise obstacles or create problems for the effective accomplishment of policy
evaluation, such as:
• Uncertainty over policy goals
• Difficulty in determining causality
• Difficulties in data acquisition
• Official resistance
• A limited time perspective
• Evaluation lacks influence
Problems in Policy Evaluation
(Hague & Harrop, 2015).
 Social policies can be defined as public interventions affecting the distribution of vital
opportunities for citizens and their general well-being. Such a generic definition
should acknowledge other public policies, which also aim at the improvement of
people’s living conditions and the advancement of social citizenship rights.
 Thus, social policies interact with education policies to provide a higher level of formal
instruction to citizens, as well as with those policies concerning health promotion,
access to housing, or subsidies for income maintenance purposes.
 In general, public polices concern either the individual (distributive and regulatory) or
the society as a whole (constituent and redistributive). Social policies are mainly
redistributive as they imply transfers and a balancing of resources and capacities
among citizens.
Social policy
(Alt, et al, 2011)
Cultural policy
Broadly defined, cultural policy deals with institutional support and guidance for
ways of life or culture as understood in anthropology. Such support can include
the diffusion of governance to make possible the cultivation of specific tastes and
habits, through educational and other means.
Examples of cultural policy include the support of particular languages and other
symbols of nationhood to foster patriotism and nationalism.
Cultural policy can be viewed in the narrow sense of institutional support for
creative and aesthetic human expression, yet all cultural expressions, narrow or
broad, are important for cultural identities and often emerge at the forefront of
political debates.
(Alt, et al, 2011)
Crime policy
Government response to crime begins first with defining what
constitutes criminal behavior. In totalitarian regimes, crime is often
defined as any behavior that threatens the authority of the state. In
liberal democracies, crime often mirrors the public’s judgment of right
and wrong behavior. Although these judgments may vary from state to
state, most democratic nations condemn behavior that threatens the
life, liberty, and property of others.
(Alt, et al, 2011)
Environmental policy
 Environmental policy encompasses a wide range of governmental actions that deal with environmental quality
or the use of natural resources. It includes the traditional focus on the conservation or efficient use of natural
resources such as public lands and waters, wilderness, and wildlife.
 Regional environmental accords also are increasingly common, most notably and successfully in the
European Union, which generally has adopted tougher requirements than those found in the United States.
 Sometimes governments choose not to adopt formal policies and thus implicitly leave many or most decisions
about certain environmental and resource problems (e.g., the level of energy use) to individuals, corporations,
and the operations of the free market.
 Hence, governments find it easier to do nothing in the short term, an outcome that is common in the
international arena when nations cannot come to an agreement on what to do in light of their often-divergent
national interests.
 Governments also may choose to adopt environmental policies that rely heavily on market-based approaches
and thus minimize direct regulation of the target activity while maintaining market competition and a minimal
government role.
(Alt, et al, 2011)
Classically, national security has been defined as freedom from foreign
interference or influence—military, economic, or political — in domestic
affairs. Obviously, this definition primarily involves physical security from
military invasion.
However, national security involves not only the defense of a nation and
that nation’s safety but also protection of that nation’s interests, whether
they be political or economic.
As to the means of protection, there are three basic methods: diplomatic
means, legal means, and military means. Each of these means is usually
instituted according to a policy.
National Security Policy
(Alt, et al, 2011)
1. Once underway, the formation of policy on most problems is continuous.
2. In a modem, pluralistic society, policymaking is likely to be complex, untidy, and perhaps unruly.
3. Policymaking in the United States tends to be adversarial, more characterized by conflict than
cooperation.
4. Policy analysis has become more extensive and more utilized in the legislative and administrative
venues.
5. Conventional wisdom holds that policymaking in the United States is mostly incremental.
6. Although conflict in policymaking attracts attention, there is also routine, low visibility, low-conflict
policymaking.
7. Change, sometimes designated as reform, is a constant feature of the policy process.
8. Despite frequent complaints about government or policy failures, public policies collectively
accomplish much to resolve or ameliorate public problems.

Arguments against of globalization
(Baylis, 2020)
So, what is Globalization?
 A theory is not simply some grand formal model with hypotheses and assumptions.
Rather, a theory is a kind of simplifying device that allows you to decide which facts matter
and which do not.
 And globalization particularly can be explained from different theoretical perspectives:
realism, liberalism, Marxism, constructivism, poststructuralism, postcolonialism, etc.
 Perhaps none of these theories has all the answers when it comes to explaining world
politics in a global era. In fact, each sees 'globalization' differently.
 But, if to simplify it, this is a feeling and a consciousness that world is a single political,
economic and social place.

Conceptualizing globalization
 Globalization denotes a tendency towards the growing extensity,
intensity, velocity, and deepening impact of worldwide
interconnectedness.
 Globalization is associated with a shift in the scale of social
organization, the emergence of the world as a shared social space, the
relative deterritorialization of social, economic, and political activity,
and the relative denationalization of power.
 Globalization can be conceptualized as a fundamental shift or
transformation in the spatial scale of human social organization that
links distant communities and expands the reach of power relations
across regions and continents.
 Globalization is to be distinguished from internationalization and
regionalization.
(Baylis, 2020)
'The intensification of worldwide
social relations which link distant
localities in such a way that local
happenings are shaped by events
occurring many miles away and
vice versa.'

supraterritorial relations between people.'

Globalization, to varying degrees, is evident in all the principal sectors of social interaction:
Patterns of contemporary globalization
Economic
•Patterns of worldwide
trade, finance, and
production are creating
global markets and, in
the process, a single
global capitalist
economy. Multinational
corporations organize
production and
marketing on a global
basis while the
operation of global
financial markets
determines which
countries get credit and
on what terms.
Military
• The global arms trade,
the proliferation of
weapons of mass
destruction, the growth
of transnational
terrorism, the growing
significance of
transnational military
corporations, and the
discourse of global
insecurity point to the
existence of a global
military order.
Legal
• The expansion of
transnational and
international law from
trade to human rights,
alongside the creation
of new world legal
institutions such as the
International Criminal
Court, is indicative of
an emerging global
legal order.
Ecological
•A shared ecology
involves shared
environmental
problems, from global
warming to species
protection, alongside
the creation of
multilateral responses
and regimes of global
environmental
governance.
Cultural
•A complex mix of
homogenization and
increased
heterogeneity given the
global diffusion of
popular culture, global
media corporations,
communications
networks, etc.,
simultaneously with the
reassertion of
nationalism, ethnicity,
and difference.
Social
•Shifting patterns of
migration from South to
North and East to West
have turned migration
into a major global
issue as movements
come close to the
record levels of the
great nineteenthcentury movements of
people.
(Ba ylis, 20 20 )
Engines of globalization
Technology
•Central to any
account of
globalization
since it is a truism
that without
modern
communications
infrastructures, a
global system or
worldwide
economy would
not be possible.
Economics
• Crucial as
technology is.
Globalization is
specifically
economic logic.
Capitalism's
insatiable
requirement for
new markets and
profits leads
inevitably to the
globalization of
economic activity.
Politics
• Shorthand here
for ideas, interests,
and power
constitutes the
third logic of
globalization. If
technology
provides the
physical
infrastructure of
globalization,
politics provides its
normative
infrastructure.
(Baylis, 2020)
The World Politics and IR
 Taking globalization seriously requires a shift in the way we think about world politics.
 Historically speaking, the study of international relations has largely concerned the study of
states and the effects of anarchy on their foreign policies, the patterns of their interactions, and
the organization of world politics.
 Recurring failures lead political scientists to try to understand the conditions under which
states and other actors can achieve their collective purposes rather than engage in
destructive, and often self -destructive, behavior.
 The study of world politics begins with the study of war. In te rn a tio n a l se cu rity g re w o u t o f

The emergence of modern IR
 In terms of political identity the medieval system was characterised by what Walker
(1990) calls the principle of hierarchical subordination: ‘an understanding of the world as
a continuum from low to high, from the many to the few, from God’s creatures to God,
from the temporal to the eternal’. All individuals were located at particular levels of
society: at the top stood God (Jesus, Allah), and under God, the Pope (Imam) and the
Emperor/King.
 The transition from the medieval to the early modern state heralded a significant
beginning of the dismantling of a hierarchy of identities, but early modern territorial
states were still governed by largely non -democratic rulers. The French and American
revolutions were thus a major shift in that the beheading of the monarch, either
concretely or symbolically, and the introduction of popular sovereignty, accelerated the
disintegration of hierarchies between different categories of people inside the state.
 The fusion of nationalism with the sovereign territorial state had several implications for
how security was conceptualised and thus how debates have evolved within IR.
 From this followed an important shift in how the relationship between the state and
citizens was approached .
(Bu za n & Ha n se n , 20 0 9)
Deterrence and the Cold War
 The Cold War affected to the military, political, technological and strategic aspects of the superpower
rivalry.
 Two big defining features came into play almost simultaneously: nuclear weapons and a rivalry between
the US and the Soviet Union to promote either democratic capitalism or totalitarian communism.
 This rivalry, and the fact that the US and the Soviet Union quickly became by far the largest holders of
nuclear weapons, was captured in the concepts of superpower and bipolarity .

The pressure of other affairs and ‘events’

evolution of IR during its first four decades, but they were not the only driving
forces in play.

Arms race and nuclear threat
Governments on both sides of the Iron Curtain held their populations – and the planet – hostages to nuclear disaster
 Nuclear arms race: The Manhattan Project, The Trinity Test (July, 1945), Hiroshima and Nagasaki Bombings (August, 1945).
 Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test (August, 1949) – 456 nuclear tests between 1949 -1989
 1957 to 1968 : Period of 'Missile Crisis' and the ICBM Race – the end of the US monopoly during the first phase, when
the Soviets successfully tested the ICBM (Inter -Continental Ballistic Missiles) in 1957.
 1968 to Late 1970's: Period of MIRV (Multiple Independently Targetable Reentry Vehicle) by the US (Soviets mastered the
technology in 1974) and ICBM Race – Anti -Ballistic Missile (ABM) and Anti -Satellite (ASAT) missile.
 1981: Regan's Strategic Modernization Plan – strategic military plan worth of 160$ billion
 1983: Militarization of Space – the militarization of space began from 1958 and since then, over 2219 satellites - military
and civilian have been launched by the superpowers and other nations, and 75% of the satellites launched have been for
surveillance and military use, thus clearly violating the Space Treaty of 1967.
 Reagan's Star Wars Programme - the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) relying on three new types of nonnuclear
weapon system: Kinetic Energy Weapons, Directed Energy Weapons, Microwave Energy Weapons.
 1984 -1991: Nuclear Arms Race in the Gorbachev Era and the Last Days of Collapsing Soviet Union - the situation was
still more or less the same except that there was a little movement towards arms control. However, certain positive
developments took place which definitely halted the arms race in the long run: settlement of disputes in Afghanistan,
Namibia, Iran -Iraq War, Israel -PLO and South Africa, reduction of Soviet troops in Europe.
 Collapse of the Soviet Union - despite the demise of Socialist Soviet Union nuclear weapons still remain the basis for
military power and their quest continues by many third world countries e.g. India, Pakistan, South Africa, Israel, Iran, Iraq
and North Korea.
The end of an era
 Overall, there was an understanding that, whatever the differences between superpowers,
they shared some important common goals, including a desire to avoid nuclear war , to
prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to other powers , a n d to manage a European
continent th a t h a d b e e n th e site o f tw o g re a t w a rs in th e p a st.

International Security & Peace Movements
 Security widely implies to freedom from threats (individual, national, international or
global).
 Peace is considered to be one of the highest values of life. The concept of peace changes
in response to the charge in the context and characters of history.
 Early peace societies were engaged in the debates over the issues like just and unjust
wars, need of violence, colonialism, etc. Debates gradually arose over the subjects such as
linking peace with social issues, like the slavery, the racism, the emancipation of women,
universal education and other fundamental human rights.
 As the result, the notion of ensuring security has been broadened to include political,
economic, societal, and environmental, as well as military aspects (non -traditional VS
traditional security).
 Peace movements address not only antiwar and antinuclear issues, it also addressed
racism, sexism, poverty, imperialism, and environmental degradation.

Women as a particular group: the birth of
Feminist Security Studies
 Feminism as an academic discipline grew out of the feminist movement of the 1 960s and l 970s -a movement
dedicated to achieving political, social, and economic equality for women.
 Many feminists link constructing knowledge to political practice. This form of knowledge -building is called
emancipatory knowledge .
 Liberal feminists believe that removing legal obstacles can overcome women's subordination. However, all the
other approaches - post -liberal - see deeply rooted structures of patriarchy in all societies, which cannot be
overcome by legal remedies alone.
 When we think of characteristics such as power, autonomy, rationality, and public, we associate them with
masculinity or what it means to be a 'real man'. Opposite characteristics, such as weakness,
dependence/connection, emotionality, and private, are associated with femininity . Studies have shown that both
women and men assign a more positive value to masculine characteristics.
 Therefore, gender is crucial for analysing global politics and economics , particularly with respect to issues of
inequality, insecurity, and social justice.
 Militarized masculinity is popular when states are preoccupied with national security threats, consequently
conciliatory options in policy -making tend to get discounted and it is difficult for women’s voice to be regarded as
legitimate, particularly in matters of security policy.
 Feminists define security broadly to include the diminution of all forms of violence: physical, economic, and
ecological.

Kazakhstan’s energy profile
 Until 2015, Kazakhstan was among the world’s top ten fastest -growing economies, mainly owing to
development of its rich oil, gas and coal resources and its export -oriented policies. The country is the
largest oil producer in Central Asia, with the 12th -highest proven crude oil reserves in the world.
 Kazakhstan is a major producer of all fossil fuels (coal, crude oil and natural gas).
 In 2018, Kazakhstan was the world’s 9th -largest coal producer (108 million tonnes [Mt]). It ranked 17th in
the world for crude oil production (91.9 Mt), and 24th for natural gas (38.7 bcm ).
 It is the first energy producer among EU4Energy focus countries (16th in the world in 2018). It produces
more than twice as much crude oil as Azerbaijan but around half the natural gas produced in
Turkmenistan.
 Kazakhstan’s total energy production (178 million tonnes of oil equivalent [Mtoe] in 2018) covers more
than twice its energy demand.
 Coal represents around half of Kazakhstan’s energy mix (50% in 2018), followed by oil and natural gas
(both with 25% shares).
 Coal is mostly transformed into electricity and heat before reaching the final consumer. Coal fuels
around 70% of electricity generation (in 2018), followed by natural gas (20% in 2018).
 Industry is the primary final energy consumer (16 Mtoe in 2018), followed by the residential sector (11 Mtoe).

In 2012, the government launched the Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy defining the course for long -term economic development.
The strategy stipulates that alternative and “green” energy technologies must generate up to 50% of all consumed energy by
2050. It also declares that all mining companies should transition to environmentally friendly production only.

COMPARATIVE POLITICS
Diana Toimbek. Associate Professor, PhD Week 10
Comparative
p o litic s
Many world political leaders and parties base their
appeal on a combination of nationalism and populism. Many countries also support an idea that countries
should put national interests first and build literal and
metaphorical barriers with their neighbors and trading
partners. And only through comparing their records we
can gain real insight into the motive and thinking
behind mainstream trends.
Comparative politics is just one of the major sub-fields
of political science, but it is also arguably the most
important and the most fundamental. Its core goal is
the systematic study of government and politics in
different countries, designed to better understand
them by drawing out their contrasts and similarities.
Comparison has much to offer, including
improvements in the simple description of political
systems and institutions, helping to understand the
broader context within which they work, helping to
develop theories and rules of politics, and showing us
how similar problems are approached by different
societies.
There are two purposes of comparative politics:
broadening our understanding and predicting political
outcomes.
Five theoretical approaches to CP

Historical background of Kazakhstan
By the second half of the XV century nomads living in the territory of modern Kazakhstan started the consolidation process by
two sultans Kerey and Zhanibek who are considered as founders of Kazakh nation.
By the beginning of the XVI century there was a single Kazakh nation, where ethnonym "Kazakh" in the ancient Turkic language
means "free, independent”.
During the XVII-XVIII centuries due to inconsolable situation with neighboring nations Kazakh khans gradually signed an
assistant pack with the Russian Empire to form a temporary alliance against stronger enemies, which was a turning point of
Kazakhs’ voluntary colonization (Bridges & Sagintayeva, 2014).
Later nomadic tribal society of Kazakh nation underwent a number of changes and as a result of colonial policies experienced
large-scale agricultural land and livestock exploitations.
Almost two decades of social and cultural transformations imposed by the Russian Empire was followed by brutal economic
renovations of the Soviet Union (Bridges & Sagintayeva, 2014).
Kazakhstan was formed as an autonomous Republic within the Russian Federation in August 1920 and became the Kazakh
Soviet Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union in 1936.
Dispossession of Kazakhs, mass collectivization in the 1920s with the immobilization of livestock and forced shift to
sedentary in the 1930s brought to the “Asharshylyq” - Kazakh famine. This led to the death of from 1.5 to 4.6 million Kazakhs,
2/3 of the population at that moment, according to various sources and still is not accepted as a genocide of Soviet
government against the Kazakh nation, like the Holodomor in Ukraine (Bridges & Sagintayeva, 2014; Aqquly, 2014; Cameron,
2018; Mamashuly, 2019).
(Toimbek, 2021)
Socio-political
organization of the
Kazakh nomads
■ Many commentators have underscored the egalitarian and
democratic character of the Kazakh nomadic organization,
underlining its diffused and localized authority structure
and an open and fluid pattern of leadership.
■ At the top level of this fluid hierarchical pattern were the
sultans, who presided over the local clan organizations.
They represented the privileged ‘whitebone’ (aq suiek)
stratum known as tore, which claimed a direct lineage
from Genghis Khan.
■ The position of the khans who headed the clan
agglomerations was not hereditary: They were elected by a
gathering of sultans, judges (bi) and clan elders
(aqsaqals).
■ Another stratum of the whitebone elites was the clergy
(hoja), of Arabic origins, which claimed descent from the
Prophet Mohammad. Relative newcomers to the steppe,
they constituted the learned echelon and served as tutors
to the sultans and khans, but did not enjoy high material
status.
■ The remaining strata, known as ‘blackbone’ (qara suiek) or
commoners, were composed of local notables: bi,
aqsaqals, poets (aqyn) and others who were closer to the
common people and contributed to the cohesiveness of
the various subdivisions at the lower taxonomic level.
Since its disintegration in the mid-sixteenth
century, a tripartite system of clan
agglomerations or zhuz (hordes) dispersed over
three natural climatic zones has been
integral to the Kazakh nomadic organization.
The clan (ru) was the main axis of nomadic
organization. Kazakhs had developed what is
known as a segmentary lineage system, in
which a patrilinear unit traces its descent from
a single progenitor, while a larger unit is
subdivided into smaller components from
parent lineages through a process of branching
or segmentation.
(Dave, 2007)
Socio-political
organization of the
Kazakh nomads 2.0
■ The dependence on livestock, pastures and climatic
conditions had structured a distinct social and
cultural life-style.
■ Pastoral nomadism was a highly specialized form of
ecological adaptation, both from economic and
cultural points of view. However, nomads roamed
about and engaged in livestock breeding not for the
‘love for it’, but because they had few other options for
supporting themselves in a pre-technological setting.
■ The Kazakh nomadic system lacked the complex
social or occupational stratification that is
characteristic of agrarian societies. Prominent
Kazakh historian and ethnographer Sergali
Tolybekov noted, ‘[E]very illiterate nomadic Kazakh,
like all nomads of the world, was in the fifteenth
to the eighteenth centuries simultaneously a
shepherd and a soldier, an orator and a historian,
a poet and a singer. However, the Kazakh nomadic
organization was internally differentiated by informal
hierarchies of status and seniority within clan
segments and clan agglomerations.
Kinship and genealogy (Shezhire), deriving
salience from social and psychological
associations and not merely from a narrow
biological connection, were central to nomadic life.
A nomad was expected to be able to name his
ancestors at least to the seventh generation (Zheti
ata). Those able to recount their ancestry up to 40
generations enjoyed the highest status.
The Kazakh clan–tribal organization, on the
contrary, was highly fluid and resilient, as the
pastoral nomadic life of the Kazakhs was
dependent on their continued mobility in the face of
challenges posed by the harsh climatic conditions
and the outside world of settlers.
(Dave, 2007)
Alash Orda and the
Kazakh national
intelligentsia
■ Alash Orda, the Kazakh national party that grew out of the
Alash movement founded in 1905, and formed an anti- Bolshevik government located in Orenburg (then the
capital) that ruled the Kazakh Autonomous Republic from
1917 to 1919.
■ The Alash leader Alikhan Bukeikhanov drew attention to
the presence of two competing elites in 1910, one formed
in Russian institutions, which was open to European
values (like him), and the other increasingly Muslim and
formed in the madrasas of Central Asia and the Volga.
■ The members of the whitebone tribal aristocracy were
a major beneficiary of Russian colonial rule and were well- placed to take advantage of the extremely limited openings
for education in Russian academic institutions, a privilege
that also distanced them from the Kazakh social fabric
anchored in the aul and kinship structure. The tsarist
colonial structure provided no regular channels for
absorbing the Kazakh inorodtsy into the administration.
■ The core stratum of the Kazakh intelligentsia broadly
agreed to pursue three basic objectives: urgent land
reform (which necessitated an immediate end to Russian
land confiscation and migration into the steppe, and a
return of the confiscated land to previous owners),
territorial autonomy for Kazakhs and the development of
an educational infrastructure in the Kazakh language
written in Arabic script.

Political debates over future of nomadism
 Kazakh intelligentsia fervently debated questions such as the future of nomadism, land reforms,
autonomy, Kazakh language reforms and literacy and education in Kazakh language
newspapers and journals such as Ai qap and Qazaq.
 The Bolsheviks exaggerated the ‘backwardness ’of the Kazakhs and their lack of literacy, as they
categorized the nomads and several Muslim groups as ‘people without scripts’ (bespis’mennye
narody).
 The shared mode of communication among ordinary Kazakhs was epics, folklore and the
cultivation of memory. Hence, we simply do not have other works that have studied the
oral traditions of the Kazakhs of the period that may offer us clues on how Kazakhs imagined their
group membership and how they responded to the Alash leaders’ demand for national
autonomy.
 Almost the entire Kazakh intelligentsia affiliated with the Alash leadership was annihilated
during the Stalin terror campaigns of late 1930s, which were directed particularly against ‘national’
and ‘class’ enemies. Many were subsequently accused of harbouring bourgeois nationalism and
‘pan-Turkic’ sentiments. All throughout the Soviet period, the Kazakh Jadids and the Alash
members were portrayed as members of a ‘tribal-feudal’ aristocracy and proponents of bourgeois
nationalist views. The rehabilitation of the Alash leaders and Jadid figures began only after
Kazakhstan became a sovereign state. (Dave, 2007)
Kazakhstan and the
Politics of Hunger,
1931-34
 Soviet nationality policy had reinforced the regime’s war on nomadic life,
as Soviet government presented the eradication of nomadism as
beneficial both to Kazakhs’ growth as a Soviet nation and to the republic’s
economic development
 USSR’s policy of collectivization, launched in the winter of 1929–30, had
provoked immense human suffering throughout the republic in the
preceding two years, including famine and population flight, particularly
across the border to China.
 But by the winter of 1930–31, the food crisis inside the republic had
deepened to the extent that almost every Kazakh was in flight. For
Kazakhs, the decision to leave was not an easy one, as it meant
abandoning their ancestral pasturelands and belongings.
 This massive migration, the region’s most far-reaching population
displacement since the Zhungar invasion of the Kazakh steppe, was an
unanticipated consequence.
 For Goloshchekin, the republic’s leader and party secretary, the
appearance of otkochevniki (literally, nomads who are moving away) was
part of a necessary perekhod , or transition, in Kazakhs’ development into
a socialist nation, as Kazakhs began to shed the “backward” practice of
nomadism.
 As famine enveloped the steppe, diseases such as typhus, smallpox,
cholera, and tuberculosis began to spread, and the steppe’s relative
underdevelopment served to magnify the effects of the disaster.
 Watch the documentary movie of Zh. Mamay “Zulmat” or read the Hunger
Steppe by Cameron. (Cameron, 2018)
Government responses to Kazakh Famine
 Ruling by the Central Committee on September 17, 1932 freed all nomadic households in the republic
from centralized meat and grain procurements for two years. As well, it authorized additional grain and
seed assistance to these households by the center.
 However, the Central Committee reiterated that the settlement of nomadic Kazakhs was the correct policy,
giving license to further repressions against starving refugees.
 Though the September 17th decision promised household livestock allowances for nomads, this policy
modification meant little when there were almost no livestock left in the republic to possess.
 Many of the grain shipments that Soviet Government had promised never arrived or were heavily delayed.
Ultimately, Goloshchekin became the scapegoat for these grain shortfalls.
 Though Mirzoyan would oversee Kazakhstan’s recovery, his record is more mixed than the largely uncritical
evaluation he has received from Kazakhstani historians would indicate.
 Under Mirzoyan republic-level agencies made little effort to ensure that food aid actually reached starving
refugees; he took severe measures against organizers of flight (otkochevka), as well as those who stole
grain or livestock (called “enemies” and used brutal forms of punishment, including shooting).
 Relations between Kazakhstan and its neighbors continued to deteriorate as Kazakh officials alleged that
refugees suffered mistreatment and discrimination at the hands of officials in neighboring republics.
(Cameron, 2018)
Post-famine situation
 By late 1933, the policy of settling refugee Kazakhs where they fled eased, officials renewed their
efforts to bring limited numbers of refugees back to Kazakhstan; the project, which focused on settling
Kazakh refugees in “labor deficit regions”.
 Despite party officials’ earlier warnings, these return efforts were again plagued by accusations
 of discrimination and “national antagonisms”.
 The Kazakh famine’s final phase was marked by both a social crisis – the emergence of over a million
starving Kazakh refugees, who moved both within the republic and beyond its boundaries – as well as
the total collapse of the republic’s economy.
 Due to the death of more than a quarter of the republic’s population during the famine, the disaster
provoked a labor crisis, Kazakhstan emptied out and collective farms stood empty for lack of workers.
Far from increasing the productivity of animal husbandry through nomadic settlement and
collectivization, Soviet Government had sparked the republic’s total economic collapse.
 The program of sedentarization, reimagined in another guise, became a means of reversing the
republic’s economic crisis, and the end of the famine marked a far-reaching rearrangement of the
republic’s population.
 The Kazakhs were now collectivized, although most remained in the simplest form of collective farm, not
the enormous state farms that Soviet government had once envisaged.
(Cameron, 2018)
Demographic and Cultural Dislocation
 The high modernist Stalinist state, with its contempt for all that was ‘traditional’ and unproductive in
economic terms, saw nomadism as a parasitical form of existence.
 Arguably the most devastating effect of collectivization was not the sheer demographic loss but an
abrupt and violent uprooting of the nomadic community and culture that were anchored in the aul.
 Overpowered by the zeal to promote a profound economic transformation through massive social and
ideological engineering, the Stalinist high modernist ideology completely severed the Kazakhs’ links with
their nomadic tradition, life in the aul, knowledge of genealogy and oral folklore.
 By seeing literacy, the printed word, and a literary tradition as essential indicators of progress and
civilization, the Soviet rulers totally devalued the tradition of nomadic epics, oral folklore and the
centrality of memory in the nomadic communities.
 The Bolsheviks introduced new standardized expressions of national cultures, such as ‘national’ forms of
opera, ballet, plays and poetry, by pushing out the tradition of akyn (bards) and aitys (improvised poetry
competitions)
(Dave, 2007)
A few more words about consequences of collectivization
 The project of Soviet modernization had fallen desperately short of its goals. Collectivization was an
economic and humanitarian catastrophe across the Soviet Union, but nowhere were its effects more
disastrous than in Soviet Kazakhstan.
 Russian peasants, as well as the convicts and political exiles sent to the steppe for hard labour by
the tsarist authorities, also became the unwitting agents of colonization.
 In 1933, after the First Five-Year Plan had been declared complete, the republic still lacked basic
elements of infrastructure: Moscow did not have a direct telegraph connection with the republic’s capital,
and there were also no direct telegraph communications between Almaty and many of the republic’s
provincial centers.
 Almaty itself had no electricity and was lit by kerosene lamps. But in other respects, Soviet Government
scow achieved its goals: pastoral nomadism was destroyed as an economic system.
 The post-famine years would see a shift toward the use of seasonal migrations as a method of pasturing
livestock. During World War II, Soviet government evacuated large numbers of cattle to the steppe from
the front lines of the war, and collective farmers used Kazakhs’ old migration routes to pasture them.
Abandoning the previous emphasis on the construction of permanent “European-style” dwellings, yurts
were now praised as the style of home best suited for certain regions of the steppe.
(Cameron, 2018)
Linguistic imperialism
 The Soviet state had portrayed Kazakhstan and Central Asia as a showcase of successful modernization. CA people
were presented as the objects and recipients of a profound transformation, but it was not they who decided on the
shaping of the new order.
 Based on ethnographic observations in Kazakhstan in 1988–89 of the Institute of Ethnography at the Academy of Sciences
of the USSR, about 40% of Kazakhs no longer had an adequate command over their own language, and nearly three-fourths
of the Kazakh urban-dwellers did not use their native language in daily interactions.
 The Soviet state was fundamentally uninterested in promoting the national languages as a goal in itself. Some
Russian scholars have gone on to suggest that the support of native language education among the Central Asians denoted
their adherence to ‘traditionalism' and a resistance to any fundamental socio-economic transformation.
 Of all Soviet republics, Kazakhstan experienced the most dramatic changes in its ethnic composition throughout the Soviet
years. Khrushchev’s programme of cultivation of ‘virgin lands’ launched in 1954 brought in over a million workers from the
European regions of the Soviet Union, such as Slavs, Chechens, Germans, Chuvas, Koreans and etc.
 Hence, bilingualism’, which was a code for widening the use of Russian, referred to as the ‘language of inter-ethnic
communication’. From this perspective, the data denoting an increasing proficiency in the ‘second language’ (which
invariably was Russian for non-Russian groups) within a nationality yield more useful insights into the extent to which
the native language was losing ground
 Few government offices and educational–cultural establishments in the major cities had typewriters with Kazakh keys,
a scarcity that came to light more noticeably in the early 1990s when a state-sponsored revival of the Kazakh
language was launched. Academic and administrative offices routinely adapted the available Russian keyboard for
Kazakh letters and inserted Kazakh diacritical marks by hand.
(Dave, 2007)
Urban milieu
 The newly formed kolkhoz and sovkhoz bore the names of various Slavic cities, such as ‘Moskovskii’, ‘Leningradskii’,
‘Kievskii’, ‘Minskii’,‘Simferopolskii’, ‘Voronezhskii’, ‘Dnepropetrovskii’, ‘Yaroslavskii’, celebrating the spirit of
‘internationalism’ guiding Kazakhstan’s development.
 Vernyi, renamed Alma-Ata in 1927 (Alma-Ata was renamed Almaty in 1993), had only 4,008 Kazakhs in 1920. When it
became the capital of the reconstituted Kazakh ASSR in 1927, roughly 3% of its population was Kazakh. In 1959, ¾ of its
population was comprised of European nationalities, notably Slavs and Germans.
 As late comers to the urban milieu within their own republic, the small but fast growing number of Kazakh
migrants from the auls trove hard to integrate into the ‘internationalist’ setting of their cities by self-consciously
refraining from speaking Kazakh, or wearing Kazakh clothing in public.
 The following letter written by a newly arrived Kazakh migrant to Almaty to the Party officials in the 1950s describes the
sense of helplessness and alienation upon arrival in the city:
“Russian doctors refuse to take Kazakh-speaking patients, even require that [we] bring along interpreters. The sales
personnel in cities speak only Russian, and refuse to serve Kazakh-speaking customers. Similarly, no one speaks Kazakh in the
spheres of trade, industrial enterprises and government offices. It is impossible for Kazakhs from the aul to find any jobs here.”
 The knowledge of Kazakh literary and cultural traditions among the Soviet-educated generation of Kazakhs was derived
entirely from the small body of pre-Soviet works that were approved by Soviet ideologues and were re-written in Cyrillic
 Traumatic as it was, urbanization also heralded unprecedented opportunities for education, material well-being and
social advancement. Deplorable conditions in the aul, including poor sanitation, scarcity of water and of a diverse range of
goods and products, and lower educational standards created compelling incentives to move to the cities.
(Dave, 2007)
‘Progress’ and mobility
 Higher education in Kazakhstan was completely in Russian and no emphasis was placed upon learning Kazakh. The limited
availability and poor quality of higher education in Kazakh was the single most important factor that led Kazakhs to opt for
schooling in Russian. Kazakh-language schooling was increasingly perceived as a dead-end formula.
 The use of Kazakh in the Russified urban settings often provoked negative stereotypes of being ‘illiterate’
(negramotnye) and ‘backward’ (otstalye). Speaking Kazakh in a public space or work setting dominated by Russians was
considered not just impolite, but also risky, as it could invite allegations of ‘nationalism’ and ‘tribalism’. For Kazakhs who
had no prior access to education, Russian denoted being ‘cultured’ (kul’turnyi) and belonging to a larger, ‘European’
civilization.
 A number of young Kazakh scholars expressed their concerns over the Russianization of their republic and the virtual
absence of Kazakh in state offices and public life. They were silenced by the central government and local Kazakh
authorities; chastised for raising the ‘nationalist ideas’ and at least lost jobs.
 The debate on Kazakh language loss and mankurtizatsiia arose in response to the eventual dissolution of the
Soviet state and the failure of Russian to live up to its global promise. By then, however, the Kazakh elites as a whole, as
well as a large stratum of the subalterns, had already learned to articulate their power in the language of the dominant
culture
 Notwithstanding the horrors of Stalinism, the Soviet state was not built on coercion and terror alone. The Stalinist order
also provided unprecedented social mobility to the ordinary masses, the various ‘oppressed’ social strata and
members of the ‘backward’ nations through the zealous promotion of education, employment, socialization and
ideological indoctrination, all necessary components in constructing a high modernist socialist order.
(Dave, 2007)
Long promised “Bright Future” or expulsion of national identity?
 Some sovietologists and Central Asian social scientist argue about long-term effect of Soviet politics to national identity of
Kazakhstan, pointing to “mankurtizatsiia of the nations” (p. 50).
 Mankurt is a widely used metaphor to convey the loss of ethnic identity and native language, and has become synonymous
with being Russified. It refers to a mythical character in a novel by Chingiz Aitmatov who could not remember his ancestry,
cringed at efforts made to activate his memory, and preferred a passive, secure existence devoid of any painful memories.
 Akseleu Seidembekov, a Kazakh writer and an academic at the Institute of Literature at the Kazakh Academy of Sciences
used the term mankurtizatsiia to denote a de-ethnicization, cultural amnesia, the loss of group solidarity symbolized by the
Kazakh aul, the demise of the rich oral tradition of the nomads, and above all, the erasure of genealogy and memory which
were so central to a nomadic identity (As an example, Scandinavian countries praise their Viking past, while nomadism is still
concerned as “backward”, “archaic” practice of illiterate Kazakhs).
 Yet while the tsarist empire allowed access to Russian education and employment opportunities to a small group of Kazakhs
of higher social rank, the Soviet state opened doors to mobility for all strata of society, albeit through use of coercion and
ideological inducements.
 Learning Russian and consequently becoming a Soviet person (sovetskii chelovek) symbolized a complex cluster of
expectations and experiences for the newly urbanizing strata, which saw the mastery of Russian, often acquired at the
expense of their native language, as a means of survival in a Russian-dominated milieu and as a catalyst for personal and
collective empowerment.
 The vision of a ‘bright future’ (svetloe budushchee) promised by Soviet socialism meant that there was no looking back for
the Kazakh nomads.
(Dave, 2007)
One of the worst environmental disasters in the world –
shrinking of Aral Sea
Aral Sea that fed Kazakhstanis during the Asharshylyq
enjoyed mythological status in the USSR, feted
nationally for more than once coming to the rescue of
their starving countrymen.
The environmental disaster caused the swathe of
toxic, pesticide-strewn, salt-encrusted desert that is
growing all the time and affecting the health of
millions of people living around the Sea.
Restoration works in Aral Sea had already exceeded
some of the wildest hopes invested in it – water level
in the northern part is increasing and water surface
had increased by half.
However, amid the excitement about the fledgling
resurgence of the sea, southern side in Uzbekistan is
almost certainly will die a slow death Photo: Dan Show (Lillis, 2018)
According to one theory, the name ‘Aral’ refers not to scattering islands but to the wetlands of the Amudarya delta, christened
by nomads who viewed their watery habitat as an island among the surrounding rivers, lakes, and marshes.
A century earlier, tsarist Russia had turned Turkestan into the heartland of the Russian Empire’s cotton industry.
In the 1960s, under the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev who had a passion for grand agricultural designs, central planners of
Soviet government started a gargantuan push to divert CA’s rivers to water the thirsty cotton crops (referred as ‘white gold’),
which caused the Aral Sea to begin disappearing after surviving for 5.5 million years. Cotton was planted mostly in Uzbekistan,
whose climate – warm, arid and sunny – was perfect for the crop.
The Wasteland. Semipalatinsk-21
 Code-named Operation Pervaya Molniya (First Lightning) by the Soviets and Joe-1 by the
Americans (after their nickname for Iosif Stalin (Western: Joseph), ‘Uncle Joe’), that first
explosion was detonated at a new top-secret nuclear polygon (testing ground) opened in
1947 which would become the key for Soviet government to unlock its atomic ambitions.
 It was located at a site selected by Stalin’s chief of secret police Lavrentiy Beria, on the
grounds that it was ‘uninhabited’. At least that was the official line.
 But the spot chosen for the polygon, at 18,500 square km slightly bigger than Kuwait, lay on
the doorstep of Kazakhstan’s industrial heartland: the city of Semipalatinsk was 120 km
away, and a little further afield lay the urban centres of Karaganda, Ust-Kamenogorsk and
Pavlodar. For hundreds of km around, there were also agricultural and herding communities
living off the land.
 The polygon went on to detonate 456 atomic explosions over the next 40 years, releasing
energy 2,500 times that of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.
 Little may have been known about the effects of radiation sickness in the early days, but the
devastation wrought in Nagasaki and Hiroshima had offered a glaring clue about the
destructive impact of nuclear explosions on human health and the environment.
 Semipalatinsk-21, the name for the top-secret research centre was built on the edge of the
polygon 60 km from ground zero. Around the research centre grew a new ‘closed’ town, also
called Semipalatinsk-21, existing only to service the research facility and shown on maps
simply as ‘Konechnaya’ (‘Last Stop’).
 For the Soviet rulers pursuing an atomic bomb at all costs, the people living around were at
best inconveniences whose presence would not stand in the way of national nuclear glory,
at worst hapless guinea pigs in a giant scientific experiment to win the nuclear arms race.
 On 19 October 1989, 40 years after Operation First Lightning, Semipalatinsk detonated its
The first Soviet nuclear test at Semipalatinsk on August 29, 1949 last atomic explosion, and in 1991 Nazarbayev signed the polygon out of existence

“One such guinea pig was Eliugazy Nurgaliyev, who was
among 43 young men kept under medical observation for
years after being ordered to remain behind when their village
was evacuated ahead of an explosion in the early 1950s.
‘The military people took us to the middle of the steppe, gave
us a tent, food and music and told us to enjoy the picnic,’ the
octogenarian told a journalist decades later. ‘Suddenly the
sky turned red and a big red storm gathered above our
village. We lost our minds.’4 Yet owing to secrecy
surrounding the nuclear programme, researchers say it is
hard to quantify how widespread the deliberate use of local
people as research subjects was. ”
Excerpt From
Dark Shadows, 2018
Lillis, Joanna
Extract from the Austrian newspaper about 36 000 Kazakhs who were sent for
decontamination works to Chernobyl. Only 7000 of them had returned. Further
information about their lifespan or health conditions are unknown.
Zheltoqsan – in Kazakh ‘90 winds’ (evoking the gales that buffet the land during the
ferocious season) – is anti-Soviet uprising in Kazakhstan which was brutally
suppressed, killing thousands of people and bringing ruthless reprisals against the
mainly Kazakh protesters, who were vilified across the USSR for what the Kremlin
deemed a violent outbursts of nationalism and extremism
(Lillis, 2018)
Pre-history of Zheltoqsan
 The empowerment of the backward or subaltern nations was acritical step in laying the foundation of the Soviet
multinational state, whose eventual aim was to dissolve ethno-national differences and establish a Soviet socialist
community of nations.
 Notwithstanding the pervasive institutionalization of nationality at the sub-state level, the normative and discursive
taboo on articulating nationalism, understood as the political assertion of group claims, deterred the development of an
autonomous national identity discourse or the mobilization of ethno-cultural claims.
 Soviet state erected, institutionalized and legitimized a structure of titular ethnic entitlements in Kazakhstan while steadily
undermining the political salience of ethnicity.
 The national elites, by-products and beneficiaries of Soviet socialist subsidies and affirmative action, have been able
to pose as legitimate representatives of their nation despite their thorough co-optation in the Soviet system through
patronage networks between the centre and the republican party apparatus. Part of the Soviet-nurtured Kazakh
intelligentsia who together with the party elites at the helm of the republic’s party apparatus were among the most
prominent recipients of the affirmative action benefits that the socialist state dispensed to its ‘backward’ nations.
 The top leadership positions in Kazakhstan during the first four decades of Soviet rule were the prerogative of
Russians and other Slavs, who were referred to as ‘Europeans’. Hence, The Stalinist purges of ‘nationalists’ from themid1930s onwards altered this assessment and ‘local nationalism’ came to viewed as a major threat to the existence of
the Union and seen as an ideological crime.
 In Kazakhstan the Kazakh share in the republic was under 30 per cent and Europeans composed almost two thirds of the
republic’s population. Kazakhstan earned the epithet of a ‘microcosm of a hundred nationalities’ and a ‘laboratory of
friendship of people’.
 D. Kunaev’s personal bond with Brezhnev allowed him considerable control over the Kazakh CP apparatus. Gorbachev
then turned to the thorny task of finding an appropriate successor to Kunaev, who would be loyal to the new leadership in
Moscow rather than to the old Brezhnev–Kunaev network. (Dave, 2007)
Almaty, 1986
 Kolbin’s greatest asset from Moscow’s standpoint was that he was an outsider who could be
relied upon to execute its commands. His main responsibilities were to restore Moscow’s direct
control over the Kazakh party apparatus, curtail the influence of ‘clan–tribal networks’, and to
check the rampant ‘corruption and bribery’ within the Kazakh-dominated party apparatus.
 It was on December, 17, 1986, that thousands of demonstrators – predominantly young, ethnic
Kazakhs – took to the streets of the capital of Soviet Kazakhstan, Alma-Ata (now Almaty). They
demanded a stake in the political process, while protesting against their perceived status as secondclass citizens in their own country.
 The protest lasted several days and spread to other towns before being suppressed by Soviet security
forces in what was dubbed Operation Snowstorm (Metel’).
 An initial resolution of the Central Committee of the CPSU of July 1987 had called the protests ‘a
manifestation of Kazakh nationalism’. The movement Zheltoqsan, led by Kazakh youths to
commemorate the victims of the protests and secure release of those who had been wrongly
imprisoned was permitted to register as a social movement in May 1989.
 While it is difficult to determine who gave the order to deploy force against the protestors, it is clear
that the central and the republic party leadership acted in collusion in ousting Kunaev. Political
pluralism flowered briefly in Kazakhstan after independence, but there has since been a steady
clampdown on political freedoms.
(Lillis, 2011, Dave, 2007)
The first stage of Kazakhstan’s socio-economic
development after the Independence
 The period of 1991-1995 can be characterized as the first stage in the formation of Kazakhstan’s
statehood. In 1993 at the 9th session of the Supreme Council, the first Constitution based on the model
of the parliamentary republic was adopted. Also, at this stage, as an ex-industrial supplier of the USSR,
the country failed to continue utilizing its resources due to the deterioration of the traditional heavy
industry sector (Serin & Yuksel, 2005) and authority in the hands of elite groups with continuous internal
conflicts (Pomfret, 2005).
 Large-scale market reforms in the beginning of Independence were carried out during the deep
economic crisis: decline in production and hyperinflation that followed the collapse of the Soviet
economic model. As a result, this stage is distinguished itself by a number of “transformational shocks”
(Yakavets, 2014), as the introduction of the national currency “tenge”, deepened financial
destabilizations with hyperinflation of 2500% (M. News, 2018). This, in turn, devalued savings of the
population, led production decline in all sectors of the economy, and transformation of property through
denationalization
 As a result of weak political and economic conditions, the country faced disastrous social consequences
as mass unemployment, lack of basic social needs, and mass emigration, which in turn caused “brain
drain” and became one of the reasons for the rapid economic decline (Pomfret, 2005).
(Toimbek, 2021)
The second stage of Kazakhstan’s socio-economic
development after the Independence
 The second stage of Kazakhstan’s development is the period of 1995-2000, which witnessed limited
political pluralism and democratic changes, but significant economic transformation (Serin & Yuksel,
2005).
 The oil boom in the end of the twentieth century provided an opportunity to fix socio-political errors
without mature democratic institutions and the country had experienced revenue windfall with reliant
on natural resources.
 The inflow of investments provided a powerful rise in the oil and energy complexes, mining and
metallurgical industry, which ensured stability and subsequent growth of the country's economy.
Accordingly, Kazakhstan has become the wealthiest Central Asian country.
 However, “the most prosperous and stable country in a region widely regarded as fragile and
dysfunctional” (International Crisis Group, 2013).
 As a profitable, thus desirable piece of a wealthy area, the oil sector became the biggest and most
corrupted area, additionally leading to the “weak performance of non-oil sectors” (Pomfret, 2005).
 In addition, in 1995 the new Constitution approved the presidential system of government causing
the escalation of elitism and since underwent several amendments in 1998, 2007, and 2011.
(Toimbek, 2021)
The third stage of Kazakhstan’s socio-economic
development after the Independence
 The following stage of the socio-economic development of the country has consolidated a number of ups
and downs. During the 2000s, Kazakhstan's economy mainly focused on both exports and production
and could make significant progress towards its long-term development goals (OECD, 2017). The oil
boom at this period contributed to around 78% of GDP growth and covered all national expenditures,
starting from infrastructure to social development (Bridges & Sagintayeva, 2014).
 Between 2000 and 2014 GDP had increased to 2.8 times, average monthly wages rose from 101USD to
565USD in 2015, pension payments quadrupled, the proportion of the population living below the
subsistence level fell from 31.8% to 2.5% (OECD, 2017) and poverty line decayed from 39% in 1998 to
about 20% in 2004 (Statistical Agency of Kazakhstan 2004, as cited in Agrawal, 2008).
 Notwithstanding a number of previous diversification attempts, a gradual decrease of external and
domestic demand in oil prices caused serious challenges to Kazakhstan’s economy (World Bank Group,
2015). For instance, GDP growth in Kazakhstan steadily declined from 4.1% in 2014 to 1.2% in 2015,
and deterioration in the oil export prices led to unfavourable changes in trade. Moreover, transition to the
floating exchange rate in 2015 caused rise in inflation to 3.8% and sharp depreciation of national
currency tenge (KZT) (World Bank Group, 2015; World Bank Group, 2016).
 The government’s unsuccessful efforts in providing quality diversification and privatization of economic
activities and highly authoritarian regime during the almost 30 years of Independence weakened social,
economic, and political institutions in the country. (Toimbek, 2021)
Political race in
Kazakhstan
In a democracy, political parties are undoubtedly of great
importance and allow various social groups to express their
interests and take part in governing the state (Sayabayev,
2016). And despite of popular opinion on eternal unipolarity of
Nur-Otan political party nowadays, Kazakhstan experienced
grueling political races in the first decades of Independence.
The periodization by Z.K. Shaukenova, who divides the history of
the development of political parties in Kazakhstan into three
periods. The first period (1990–2002) is an unlimited multiparty system in which, by the end of the period, 19 parties were
recorded in the country. The second period (2002–2006) is a
moderate multi-party system with only 12 functioning parties
due to legislative restrictions. The author calls the third period
(2006 – the present) “the system of one party and a half.”
(Sayabayev, 2016).
According to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in
Europe, Human Rights Watch and Open Dialogue, Kazakhstan
had dozens of politically motivated disappearances and
felonious homicides; and politically motivated criminal cases
have been opened against at least 78 individuals.
“For me, reporting on the presidential election in
2005 was engaging, because although Nazarbayev
was a shoo-in, there were political battles being hard
fought; but reporting on his re-election a decade later
in 2015 was dispiriting, because a vote that offered
the people of Kazakhstan all the trappings of an
election without the one essential ingredient – an
actual political choice – seemed to me an insult to
their intelligence.”
Excerpt From
Dark Shadows, 2018
Lillis, Joanna
Political institutions and economic incentives in Kazakhstan
 Current socio-economic problems of the country can be explained by the inherited highly centralized governance
from the Soviet Union (OECD, 2017a) and extractive political and socio-economic history of the country from the
Independence, where citizens of Kazakhstan have never practiced “free and fair elections” (International Crisis
Group, 2013).
 Authoritarian leadership has also shaped economic institutions as highly extractive and “restricted from freely
determining their structures” (Human Rights Watch, 2019), due to the centralization of the ownership of wealthy
economic sectors within elite groups (McKee, 2002; International Crisis Group, 2013).
 Kazakhstan’s government under the concept of "economic security and stability” still directly or indirectly greatly
implies to industry development by international investments and exporting raw materials, especially oil. Also, there
are still no any leading non-raw-materials sector, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) has poor development and
financial system of the country plays a small role in the economic development of the country (Temirkhanov, 2019).
 Despite of the numerous SME initiativess, their success is currently very low and the economic contribution of the
sector is poor (OECD, 2018d). Business sector struggles with the low spending on R&D, which hinders innovation
area of the business environment. Increasing corruption, inadequate access or misuse of financial resources and
incompetent workforce add supplementary pressure on the segment development (OECD, 2018d).
 Despite the country has sufficient material and human resources potential for economic transformations, without
sound political reforms its possibilities are limited (Baigabylov, et al, 2019). Apparently, main reason of developing
countries’ struggle “to find ways to produce relevant knowledge and transform it into wealth, as well as to adapt and
disseminate existing knowledge for their development” is their weak institutions (World Bank Institute, 2007)
(Toimbek, 2021)
The legacy of five terms
The presidential election of independent Kazakhstan was held in December 1, 1991, where the First Secretary of the Communist Party of
the Kazakh SSR Nursultan Nazarbayev won it with 98.78% of the votes. Presidential pressure had forced the Supreme Soviet to disband in
December 1993, but not before almost 200 of its 350 deputies resigned late that year as a sign of protest at the impending measure
(Zhovtis, 1995).
In April 1995 Nazarbayev’s presidential term was extended by referendum till 2000. Another referendum in August 1995 produced a result
in which 89% of voters allegedly supported a draft constitution vastly expanding presidential powers. Nazarbaev gained the authority to
dissolve the parliament for, among other things, its failure to approve the president's nomination for prime minister.7 The new constitution
demoted the last significant potential barrier to complete presidential rule, the constitutional court, to a consultative body, enabling
Nazarbaev to effect any constitutional changes unchallenged (Human Rights Watch, n.d.).
Later, Parliament of Kazakhstan amended the Constitution to allow the first President of Independent Kazakhstan run unlimited times for
five-year term each.
In 2010 a group of people called themselves as “representatives of the Kazakh Republic” gathered five million signatures to encourage “a
referendum that would cancel the next two elections and make Nazarbayev president until 2020” (International Crisis Group, 2013, p. 4).
Consequently, Parliament unanimously supported another constitutional change and Nazarbayev was given the name “Elbasy”, which
means “Leader of the nation”. The title granted him unlimited political power, protection of him, his family and their property from any types
of prosecution, “prohibits public insults against him and defacing his image” (International Crisis Group, 2013), as well as the power to “veto
over all decisions until his death” (Walker, 2015).
On March 19, 2019, 78-year-old Nursultan Nazarbayev announced his retirement in favour of “a new generation of leaders” (BBC, 2019a;
Lemon, 2019). The next day chairman of the Senate Kasym-Zhomart Tokayev was sworn as an acting president until the next presidential
election and renamed the capital Astana to Nur-Sultan in the first president’s honor without the referendum and having a required official
post for that.
N. Nazarbayev currently is the life-long chairman of National Security Council, member of Constitutional Council and head of the ruling party
Nur-Otan.
Violations of basic human rights and freedom of speech became constant practice in Kazakhstan and elections in Kazakhstan, particularly,
were subject of multiple international as well as national criticisms for failing democratic canons (Holley, 2007).
Kazakhgate
 Oil has been a blessing in many ways helping
to raise standards of living and FDI flows to
the country. Yet is was a curse too since
“black gold” allowed economic development
without mature democratic institutions.
 The curse was also typified in the
“Kazakhgate” scandal by US prosecutors
investigating kickbacks shelled out for oil
contracts in Kazakhstan during 1990’s.
 The disputed assets stashed in Swiss bank
accounts in the names of Kazakh officials
were eventually donated to charity.
 The case centers allegations on James Giffen,
an American businessman who allegedly paid
$78 million in bribes to unnamed Kazakhstani
officials to secure contracts for Western oil
companies. Giffen, who was indicted in 2003,
was tried in Federal Court in New York.
 Armand de Decker, the former Belgian
development cooperation minister, is alleged
to have engaged in “influence peddling” in
connection with France-Kazakhstan trade deal
(Lillis, 2018) (Photo from Qazaq TV)
“They shot to kill”.
Zhanaozen, 2011
 The oil sector, despite its great share in
economy, fails to ensure higher living
standards even for its workers.
 Unrests of oil industry employees
demanding better payments and work
conditions in Western Kazakhstan cities in
2009, especially in Zhanaozen in 2011
were declared as illegal and met armed
suppress leaving many people dead (BBC,
2011; Kramer, 2011; The Guardian, 2011;
International Crisis Group, 2013).
 This situation is another evidence of poor
democratic practices in the country with
the “zero concept” of police in controlling
social disputes and inability of authorities
to maintain civic movements (International
Crisis Group, 2013).
(Toimbek, 2021)
The curse of
corruption
It is well-known that any practice of unethical activity destructively influences to
the very purpose of society itself, since it jeopardizes the whole system, its
quality, achievements, and missions, together with de-moralization of actors
and a whole community as well (Sahlberg, 2009).
Corruption significantly hinders the institutional developments of Kazakhstan at
all sectors. The country scored 31 out of 100 in the Corruption Perceptions
Index in 2018, with 26.45 points from 1999 and with a peak of 31 since 2017,
ranking as the 124th least corrupted state out of 175 (Trading Economics,
2019).
Corruption leads to a decrease in a country's wealth and a decline in living
standards. It interferes with business that cannot successfully develop in a
corrupt system, which leads to a reduction in the country's overall wealth;
entails a decrease in the amount of money that the government must pay to
workers and spend on the purchase of different social supplies; leads to the
fact that the money allocated by the state for the provision of social services
(schools, hospitals, roads, sewers, police, etc.) is not used properly, which
deteriorates the quality of services; creates conditions so that people who have
money and connections can change laws and regulations of state bodies in
their interests; and undermines trust in government.
One of the mournful examples of corruption is Shymkent’s HIV Scandal, when at
least 150 children were infected with HIV in hospitals, where “Doctors and
nurses had been selling blood for personal profit, and reusing disposable
syringes and catheters to cream off cash allocated to buy medical equipment”
(Lillis, 2018) (Toimbek, 2021)
Information infrastructure in Kazakhstan
 ICT is admitted as the backbone of the knowledge economy and an effective instrument for processing
sustainable economic development (Chen & Dahlman, 2006). In other words, ICTs revolutionized the way
of transferring information and knowledge despite geographic boundaries by causing a bigger flow of
them to institutions accountable for economic growth (Chen & Dahlman, 2006). Additionally, with
extended market access and global coverage “the increased flow of information, technologies can be
acquired and adapted more easily again leading to increased innovation and productivity” (Chen &
Dahlman, 2006).
 On April 12, 2006, the e-government website www.e.gov.kz began its work and more than 59 information
services were launched in such sections as defense, security, culture, environment, transport,
agriculture, land management, and so on (Eszhanova, 2020).
 It was, however, the first and almost the only result of the project. Despite, according to the United
Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), Kazakhstan was ranked 38th in the
development of e-government in the 2012 UN global review of e-government, increasing its position from
81st place in 2008 (Eszhanova, 2020).
 In general, as a result of the highly centralized political and economic institutions, the ICT sector in
Kazakhstan is also can be considered as extractive. For example, the main ICT companies such as
KazakhTelecom and Kazpost are public companies and cover almost all ICT services in the country. In
addition, Kazakhstan lacks empirical studies in the field of ICT and poor data or even their absence
hinder attempts to monitor and evaluate tendencies of the sector. (Toimbek, 2021)
Energy poverty in resource-rich country
 Until 2015, Kazakhstan was among the world’s top ten fastest-growing economies, mainly owing to development of
its rich oil, gas and coal resources and its export-oriented policies. The country is the largest oil producer in Central
Asia, with the 12th-highest proven crude oil reserves in the world.
 Kazakhstan is a major producer of all fossil fuels (coal, crude oil and natural gas). In 2018, Kazakhstan was the
world’s 9th-largest coal producer (108 million tonnes [Mt]). It ranked 17th in the world for crude oil production
(91.9 Mt), and 24th for natural gas (38.7 bcm).
 It is the first energy producer among EU4Energy focus countries (16th in the world in 2018). It produces more than
twice as much crude oil as Azerbaijan but around half the natural gas produced in Turkmenistan.
 Kazakhstan’s total energy production (178 million tonnes of oil equivalent [Mtoe] in 2018). Coal represents around
half of Kazakhstan’s energy mix (50% in 2018), followed by oil and natural gas (both with 25% shares).
 Coal is mostly transformed into electricity and heat before reaching the final consumer. Coal fuels around 70% of
electricity generation (in 2018), followed by natural gas (20% in 2018).
 Industry is the primary final energy consumer (16 Mtoe in 2018), followed by the residential sector (11 Mtoe).
 Renewable energy accounted for only 1.4% of the energy mix (TPES) in 2018. “Ambitious” plans of the country in
energy transition: share of renewables in 2025 will be 6%, 2030 -10%, and 2050 – around 50%.
 However, with the raising demand, Kazakhstan is facing energy deficiency, especially in the South.
 Therefore, due to technical limitations of wind and solar energies, NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS ARE ESSENTIAL in
Kazakhstan.
Updated from the Lecture 9. (IEA, 2021)
Domestic myth: Kazakhstan has low CO2 emissions.
Source: The World Bank
In the context of Kazakhstan, thirty years of the authoritarian regime
accumulated poor development of political and economic institutions with
acquiring all formal and informal political, economic and financial powers with
the cult of personality and economy that highly dependent on natural
resources. And despite the vaunted “peace in the region”, extractive
institutions caused vulnerable socio-economic environment, elitism, growing
corruption, mass migration, weak business environment, slowdown of FDI
flows, and suppressed democracy and civil rights. Additionally, social
accountability instruments stated in the UNESCO Report, such as social
movements, mass media, teachers’ unions, legislatures, ombudsmen and
citizens themselves are not greatly practiced in Kazakhstan.
(Toimbek, 2021)
Now what?
 In order to maintain positive changes, it is necessary to sustain an evidence-based planning of reforms, quality
monitoring and performance supervision of the progress made and equalization of human, physical and financial
resources between establishments and different regions.
Kazakhstan initiates many plans, reforms, policy changes and programmes. However, quality monitoring of the progress and following
modification through observation and evidences is not always practiced. Unfortunately, without thorough analysis and up-to-date revisions
and adjustments, any sound policy has tendency to shrink. Additionally, since Kazakhstan set ambitious political and socio-economic
strategies for the future, it is utterly important to ensure leveling tangible and material resources between establishments and different regions
in order to promote equal opportunities for all citizens to succeed.
 Another important factor to proceed with quality diversification of the country is to eradicate corruption from all
economic and social sectors by practicing the rule of law and reducing opportunities for bribery and misuse of budget.
Notwithstanding reforming the legislation, in particular in the public service, judiciary, access to information, and prosecution of corruption, many laws
in Kazakhstan do not yet fully comply with international standards, and their practical application is unstable (OECD, 2017d). Thus, public companies
remain a source of great corruption risks and as a result additional measures are required to ensure proper governance, accountability and
transparency in them. Data analyses in this research revealed that positive trends in control or corruption are able to increase country’s GDP to
almost 1%. Though, situation with corruption is Kazakhstan is not optimistic.
 The following suggestion is to start large privatization processes of national companies with R&D practices that are
competitive and accountable. In this case, it is necessary to ensure greater autonomy of public bodies and
accountability and transparency in governmental, regional and local levels.
The nationalization of all social means indicates that a state occupies a monopoly position, and the system of public life itself acts as an
authoritarian-bureaucratic government. Thus, it is central to transfer state ownership into private hands (individuals and legal entities), and to
form private or mixed forms of ownership as a result of the government's adoption of programs on social and economic transformations. In
essence, this is the foundation of inclusive socio-economic system in a country, because as a result of privatization, the state completely or
partially loses the right to own, use and dispose state property, and state bodies lose the right to directly manage it. (Toimbek, 2021)
